The IPL 2024 final is here, and the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai is set to erupt! Tonight, two titans collide &ndash; the ever-consistent Kolkata Knight Riders, led by the shrewd Shreyas Iyer, and the rampaging Sunrisers Hyderabad under the fiery leadership of Pat Cummins!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR has been the team to beat all season. They&#39;ve dominated the points table, a fortress built on the explosive starts of Sunil Narine and Phil Salt, the solidity of Venkatesh Iyer, and the sheer power of Andre Russell. And let&#39;s not forget Mitchell Starc, the most expensive buy of the season, who&#39;s been worth every penny &ndash; remember his demolition job on SRH in Qualifier 1? It was pure fire!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But SRH are no pushovers. They&#39;ve been the comeback kings, defying odds and rewriting records. Their batting, led by the young gun Abhishek Sharma and the classy Travis Head, has been a whirlwind, even smashing the highest IPL score ever &ndash; a mind-boggling 287!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>These two teams have already clashed twice this season, and both encounters were heart-stopping thrillers. But a final is a different beast. It&#39;s about nerves of steel, about handling the big occasion. KKR boasts two IPL titles, while SRH is hungry for their second.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The battle lines are drawn. Starc and Cummins, two of the world&#39;s best pacers, will be breathing fire right from the first ball. Watch out for Iyer&#39;s tactical masterstrokes and Russell&#39;s brute force. Can SRH&#39;s openers continue their fireworks, and will the experience of Bhuvneshwar Kumar hold firm?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chennai, the stage is set! The crowd will be a sea of yellow and orange, the noise deafening. Every ball will be a battle, a test of skill and temperament. This is a match for the ages, a night etched in IPL history. So, don&#39;t miss a single second! Turn up the volume, grab your favorite snacks, and get ready to witness the crowning of the IPL 2024 champions! Will it be the Knight Riders&#39; reign of consistency, or will the Orange Army rise to the occasion?

This is the third final at this venue and there have been high scores in both the previous finals. Not a lot of spin, but significant bounce.

What a season. Probably the two most exciting teams in the final. I think we had a fantastic squad and we remained such a consistent side with contributions from everyone. That was a big part of our success. About the game tonight We lost the toss and got used to the ball first. Having watched the game two nights before here, we didn&#39;t know what to expect but the bowling unit showed all the skills they have and the wicket-taking balls. It was a lot of fun for me personally and we have got an exciting attack.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; I thought they bowled fantastically. We did not have enough on the board. We were outplayed tonight. They gave nothing away. Just like the last game in Ahmedabad. It was a tricky track to figure out. Didn&#39;t feel like a 200-plus wicket. 160 would have given us a chance. The style of our play, particularly with the bat, scoring 250 three times is a good feat. So it was a great season. I had not worked with many of the guys before but it was great working with them. A great squad and the staff was amazing. Had a great time.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &nbsp;It was comprehensive. Every player responded well to what was demanded of them and stood up. It&#39;s difficult to express the feelings. So much to cherish right now. Today, we were lucky enough to bowl first. Everything went in our way. Congrats to SRH for the way they played throughout. It was a high-pressure game and Mitchell Starc had been so good off-field. Phenomenal work ethic, and something to learn from him. Russell has got a magic wand and he never fails to deliver. In the majority of the games, he gave us breakthroughs. Venkatesh Iyer made things easy for us. As I said earlier, everyone stepped up. No one individual took us here; it was a cumulative effort. It was a flawless season for us. We played invincible Cricket.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

The loser is out. There is a nice breeze flowing across the ground, but the humidity is quite severe.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>We are on pitch number seven. It&#39;s interesting because this pitch hasn&#39;t been used at all in TATA IPL 2024. It&#39;s uniquely positioned in the square. It&#39;s just 61 meters to my left, 72 meters to my right, and 77 meters down the ground. Matthew Hayden is here with me. He has spent a few seasons here. This pitch looks darker compared to the others. What does that mean for us?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayden: &quot;This surface is extremely hard, made of black clay, which means it will hold together well. There will be a nice bounce for the pacers but not much turn for the spinners. The only advantage for spinners will be the huge boundary. In terms of runs, I feel it&#39;s a 175-180 kind of wicket. Don&#39;t be surprised if Sunrisers Hyderabad bat first if they win the toss, as their blueprint is to score massive and put pressure on the Royals.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bishop: &quot;The groundsmen say there won&#39;t be any dew tonight.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (27)_1716558263.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS: <span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Field First&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (9)_1716559444.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0099\">Sanju Samson |&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We would like to bowl first, considering what Chepauk usually offers in the second stage of a match.We&#39;re doing our best to recover.

Defending a modest 175, SRH&rsquo;s bowlers spun a web around RR, who fell 36 runs short, setting up a grand finale clash with Kolkata Knight Riders.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SRH&rsquo;s innings wobbled early, losing quick wickets, including Abhishek Sharma&rsquo;s blitz of 12 off 5. However, Heinrich Klaasen&rsquo;s fiery 50 off 34 balls, laced with 4 massive sixes, and Rahul Tripathi&rsquo;s rapid 37 off 15 balls steadied the ship. Despite Trent Boult and Avesh Khan snaring 3 wickets each, SRH managed to post a competitive total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The chase was a rocky road for RR. Yashasvi Jaiswal&rsquo;s explosive 42 off 21 gave hope, but SRH&rsquo;s Shahbaz Ahmed (3/23) and Abhishek Sharma (2/24) turned the screws tight, dismantling RR&rsquo;s middle order. Dhruv Jurel&rsquo;s lone battle, scoring an unbeaten 56 off 35, was in vain as the rest of the lineup crumbled.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Key moments included SRH&rsquo;s early wickets and Shahbaz Ahmed&rsquo;s game-changing spell. Despite Jurel&rsquo;s heroics, RR couldn&rsquo;t muster the partnerships needed, and SRH&rsquo;s bowlers shone, securing a spot in the final showdown.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As SRH gear up to face KKR, the Royals will reflect on a season that promised much but ultimately fell short. The stage is set for a pulsating final, with SRH looking to cap off their bowling brilliance with the ultimate prize.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (15)_1716576073.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0099\">Sanju Samson <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;It was a big game.

They bowled really well.We&#39;ve had some brilliant games over the last three years and found great talent like Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel.

The boys have been fantastic throughout the season. There has been a great vibe in the dressing room, and you can see that. The final was the goal, and we&#39;ve made it.We knew our strength was our batting, but we wouldn&#39;t underestimate the experience in the side. Guys like Bhuvi, Natarajan, and Unadkat keep stepping up.(On who decided to bring in Shahbaz Ahmed as the impact sub) It was Daniel Vettori. He wants as many left-arm spinners as possible.(On Abhishek Sharma&#39;s bowling) That was a surprise. Travis Head went out with a couple of right-handed batters. But he did really well in the middle overs.Finals are always funny. You never know. With 170 on the board, after a couple of wickets, things can really turn.It is.

Leading the charge for Bengaluru are Virat Kohli and Rajat Patidar, who have consistently been at the forefront of the team&#39;s scoring.

You lose and you go home. Both teams coming in with contrasting form. RCB, winning streak. RR on a losing streak. I&#39;m standing here just beside the pitch that was used yesterday and the boundaries were equidistant. Today, it is slightly different. Away to my right, 61 m. That&#39;s a short side. 68 m to my left and 73 m down the ground. Again, the captains will be looking for the match-ups and force the guys to hit to the bigger boundary. Matthew Hayden who could clear all these easily. Matthew come in and what do you think about tonight&#39;s surface?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayden:&nbsp;&quot;I see that it is very similar actually. It&#39;s quite dry. It&#39;s extremely firm. It&#39;s maybe got a little bit of grass cover. Last night, in my opinion, the dew dramatically affected the game. It became a lot better as the evening went on. It&#39;s currently now 43 degrees Celsius. It has been 48 degrees Celsius. It has been sweat on. But there is so much water in the surface that it is creating so much of dew.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>But on the surface, as a whole, also the wicket on this wicket has been something that the groundsmen had to control because of the heat. There was a little bit of seam movement early on and a little bit of swing. So watch out for those fast bowlers to get that movement laterally or through the air. Otherwise, this wicket was a very high-scoring wicket in the group stages. Lots of runs.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024_1716387245.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS : <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#ff0099\">Won The Toss and Elected to Bowl&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Untitled_1716387030.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>Sanju Samson <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper :&quot;We&#39;ve opted to bowl first, considering the dew factor later in the evening.

But the confidence will come back.In the first half of the season, my body wasn&rsquo;t moving well, and I had an abdomen injury. I wanted to put my body on the line for the team. It was about finding rhythm and hitting the right lengths. Transitioning from Test matches to T20s, your body needs time to adjust. As the tournament progressed, I needed a lot of repetitions. It&#39;s not easy as I age, but I managed.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

They removed the Hessian half an hour ago, and with the heat, moisture levels are crucial. The middle areas are quite dry, favoring off-pace deliveries. Watch for Pat Cummins and others who excel at this.There&#39;s a slight darker patch indicating some moisture, but overall, the pitch is hard and short, leading to high scores.

Their eight-wicket triumph over the Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) in the first qualifier left fans awestruck.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR&rsquo;s opening duo, Sunil Narine and Rahmanullah Gurbaz, set the stage on fire. They pummeled SRH&rsquo;s bowlers, racing to 44 runs in the powerplay. Gurbaz&rsquo;s cameo ended at 23, but Venkatesh Iyer joined Narine in the assault. By the end of the fielding restrictions, KKR had already amassed 63 runs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Skipper Shreyas Iyer and Venkatesh Iyer continued the onslaught. Their 50-run partnership was a masterclass in controlled aggression. Venkatesh&rsquo;s elegant fifty off 28 balls was matched by Shreyas, who reached his half-century in just 23 deliveries. The Iyers remained unbeaten, guiding KKR to victory in a mere 13.4 overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR&rsquo;s bowlers were equally lethal. Mitchell Starc&rsquo;s fiery spell dismantled SRH. He dismissed Travis Head for a golden duck and sent Abhishek Sharma packing. Nitish Reddy and Shahbaz Ahmed fell victim to Starc&rsquo;s venomous deliveries, leaving SRH reeling at 39/4.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SRH fought back through Rahul Tripathi and Heinrich Klaasen. Their 62-run partnership steadied the ship. Klaasen&rsquo;s aggressive innings ended at 32, but Tripathi&rsquo;s gritty 55 kept SRH afloat. Unfortunately, a mix-up led to Tripathi&rsquo;s run-out, and SRH finished at 159.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR&rsquo;s bowlers hunted in packs. Starc&rsquo;s 3/34 stole the show, while Varun Chakaravarthy&rsquo;s economical 2/26 added to SRH&rsquo;s woes. The bowlers paved the way for KKR&rsquo;s batsmen.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SRH&rsquo;s missed catches and strategic blunders cost them dearly. Captain Pat Cummins&rsquo; early bowling gamble backfired, and the Impact Player strategy misfired.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR&rsquo;s emphatic win propels them to the IPL 2024 final, their fourth appearance in the tournament&rsquo;s history. A decade after their last title, they stand on the brink of glory. Meanwhile, SRH faces the winner of the Eliminator, keeping their campaign alive.&nbsp;Shreyas Iyer become the first ever captain to lead two franchises to IPL finals, DC in 2020 and KKR in 2024 !</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Stay tuned for more IPL 2024 fireworks as the road to the grand finale unfolds!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (12)_1716314913.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />Skipper: &quot;We need to put this one behind us quickly. In T20 cricket, you have days when it doesn&#39;t work out. We earned the right to get another shot at reaching the final, and it&#39;s good we get another crack at it.It was just one of those days. A few guys didn&#39;t get starts, and we couldn&#39;t deliver with the ball either. We would have loved to have Umran on that wicket, but with wickets falling, we thought an extra batter was needed.I thought KKR bowled really well, and then the wicket got better for batting.Starting fresh at a new venue helps. We have a good body of work this season, and we hope to turn things around in Chennai.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Elated by the performance. Everyone chipped in, and I&#39;m delighted with the way the team took responsibility.Traveling from one state to another isn&#39;t easy, especially from Kolkata to Guwahati. We weren&#39;t focused on the past but aimed to maximize tonight.The way each bowler stood up was brilliant. Even when we went at nine runs per over, the attitude to come back and pick wickets was crucial.Our bowling lineup&#39;s variety has been consistent. No one takes their place for granted, and we hope to continue the winning momentum.Gurbaz gave us an impactful start in his first game, and Sunil followed through. We made sure to carry forward that momentum.Communicating with Venkatesh was fun; he spoke Tamil, which I understand but can&#39;t speak, so I replied in Hindi (laughs).Right now, it&#39;s important to enjoy the moment. We&#39;ve won an important game, but come match day, we&#39;ll stay focused.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Mitchell Starc </strong></span><strong>(Player of the Match <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> )</strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>: &quot;We know how important the powerplay is. Taking early wickets against a team like Hyderabad disrupts their middle order. Travis and Abhishek have been playing well, liking the width to free their arms. Swinging the ball and keeping it in line with the stumps, as we did in the powerplay, was key. Our spinners and the whole bowling unit performed great tonight.(On Head&#39;s wicket) Got lucky, I guess (chuckles). It was nice to get Trav out early, but he&#39;ll probably come out swinging in the next game. They&#39;re exciting to watch and hugely talented.Our attack is young and raw, with skillful players ready to step in if needed. Guys like Harshit have been phenomenal. Our whole bowling attack has been great, and it&#39;s wonderful to see them firsthand. No doubt, they have many wickets in them in the IPL.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

KKR, riding high on a wave of victories, aims to keep the juggernaut rolling. Meanwhile, the Royals, having hit a rough patch with four consecutive losses, are desperate to rediscover their winning formula. A triumph today would seal a top-two finish for them, no matter how the tides turn in the SRH-PBKS game.As we gear up for the final league fixture, it&rsquo;s a summit clash in Guwahati. The Knights, perched at the pinnacle, are unassailable at the top. But for the Royals, it&rsquo;s a do-or-die affair to clinch that coveted top-two berth after a string of defeats.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Reflecting on their last outing, the Royals faced a setback against the Kings, with Riyan Parag&rsquo;s valiant effort falling short. The Kings, led by Curran&rsquo;s captain&rsquo;s innings, overhauled RR&rsquo;s total with ease.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, as we stand on the cusp of the 70th match of this electrifying Indian T20 League, it&rsquo;s the final group game, a prelude to the playoff drama. Rajasthan, once a juggernaut with 8 wins from 9, now finds themselves in a must-win tussle to secure a top-two spot, sans their powerhouse Buttler. Kolkata, on a five-match unbeaten streak, will miss the services of their dynamo Salt, but Gurbaz is all set to step into those big shoes.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rewind to their previous face-off this season at the iconic Eden Gardens, where Rajasthan chased down a mammoth 224 in a nail-biter. Expect fireworks once again as these two giants collide. Who will emerge victorious?<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head In IPL:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (35)_1716124869.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nPlayers Battles To Watch Out For:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for (18)_1716125043.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Anjum Chopra and Matthew Hayden:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Anjum: &quot;It is nice to be in the Eastern part of the country for the last league game of the season. Actually, I am not very happy saying it. But since we are in Guwahati, we are in the center of the ground. The square boundaries are 61m and 62m, pretty much equidistant. The straight boundary is the one that challenges the batters a bit more at 73m. The last game played here wasn&#39;t high-scoring, but we often see high-scoring games here.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayden: &quot;We&#39;ve got a cracking wicket for the game. It&#39;s a different-looking surface from the last game, which was low-scoring. Last year, Rajasthan Royals got 199 on this same wicket, and Delhi Capitals couldn&#39;t chase it down. So, I&#39;d suggest batting first. It&#39;s an extremely hard pitch with a good sheen to it, ideally prepared with an even covering of grass. There are a couple of areas on the pitch where the grass is missing but still has that sheen look. The ball will slide onto the bat. Remember, in the last game, the spinners came into play, and it was tricky for the batters who had to rotate the strike.

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) are locking horns with Punjab Kings (PBKS) in a high-octane clash. The stakes? Sky-high!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SRH, led by the fiery Pat Cummins, have been scorching the pitch. Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma&mdash;like two blazing meteors&mdash;have anchored their batting lineup. But hold your horses! A recent washout against Gujarat Titans has left them a tad rusty. Now, they&rsquo;re out to reclaim their mojo in this do-or-die group stage finale.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>PBKS, on the flip side, are playing with pride as their armor. Skipper Sam Curran, the swashbuckling hero, smashed an unbeaten 63 off just 41 balls in their last outing against Rajasthan Royals. But wait, there&rsquo;s a twist! They&rsquo;ll miss Jonny Bairstow and Sam Curran&mdash;like a ship without its anchors. Yet, their bowling brigade, led by Harshal Patel and Arshdeep Singh, stands tall.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, picture this: the sun-kissed Hyderabad pitch, ready for battle. Bats will sing, boundaries will dance, and the crowd will roar.&nbsp;But here&rsquo;s the twist in the tale: SRH needs a win and a sprinkle of luck in the Rajasthan game to secure a top-two spot. PBKS? They&rsquo;re aiming to exit with a bang, fireworks lighting up the night sky.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nHead to Head&nbsp;<br />\nSRH&rsquo;s got the upper hand, winning their last two encounters against PBKS. In their previous face-off this season, SRH clinched victory by a mere 2 runs&mdash;a nail-biter that had fans on the edge of their seats!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (3)_1716111347.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nMilestone Alert&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1- <span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Heinrich Klaasen</span> (49) needs one four to complete 50 fours in IPL.<br />\n1- <span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Jaydev Unadkat </span>(99) needs one wicket to get to 100 IPL Wickets.<br />\n26-<span style=\"color:#e67e22\"> Aiden Markram</span> (974) needs 26 runs to complete 1000 runs in IPL.&nbsp;<br />\n42 -<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Jitesh Sharma </span>(2458) needs 42 runs to complete 2500 runs in T20s.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBattles To Watch Out For&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for (4)_1716111386.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Mpumelelo Mbangwa &amp; Brian Lara:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mbangwa: &quot;In Hyderabad, it&rsquo;s very hot, especially during an afternoon game. Captains need to consider this. The field dimensions are 66 meters for the square boundaries and 78 meters down the ground.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lara: &quot;I&rsquo;m expecting a lot of runs because there&rsquo;s absolutely no grass on this surface. The lack of grass means the ball will get dirty quicker, which will help the spinners later on. However, given the aggressive nature of these two teams, I still expect a high-scoring game. There&rsquo;s a bit of cracking on the surface, but I don&rsquo;t think it will affect play for the next three hours.Any damage to this pitch will come from the bowler&rsquo;s foot marks. There might be a bit of spin later, but it&rsquo;s an absolute belter. SRH would love to finish this part of the tournament with another big score. Many teams fear bowling first against SRH. If I were the opposition, I&rsquo;d prefer to bat first. I believe that the winning captain, whether it&rsquo;s SRH or Punjab, will choose to bat first.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (24)_1716111876.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS : <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/SRHVSPBKS_1716114970.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Jitesh Sharma |&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot; We&#39;ve decided to bat first because the wicket looks good.

Their pivotal knocks have steered SRH to a win that&rsquo;s as vital as they come.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With this clinical performance, the Sunrisers have soared to the second spot in the points table. The Punjab Kings, earlier in the day, put on a show with the willow. Taide, Rossouw, and Prabhsimran - the trio set the stage with a formidable 214/5. But the Sunrisers, they&rsquo;ve been in imperious form with the bat, and today was no different. Despite losing Travis Head early, Abhishek and Tripathi launched a counter-attack in the powerplay, sending the Punjab bowlers into a tizzy. Nitish Reddy and Klaasen then stepped up, delivering the crucial blows. And though wickets fell towards the end, SRH crossed the line with an over to spare.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The stage is set, the players are ready, and the next game will be the decider.

From the first ball, my intent was to go after the bowler because the target was high, and I wanted to contribute.The hard work I&#39;ve put in before this season is paying off now. In SMAT, I was clear about targeting and dominating the bowlers, and I want to continue with that approach as it&rsquo;s working well.Brian Lara was our coach last year, and I worked a lot under him. I&#39;m still in touch with him now.I wait for the balls I want the bowler to bowl to me. They are bowling loose and a bit defensively, so I make sure they are under pressure.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>In the grand tapestry of IPL 2024, the M Chinnaswamy Stadium is bracing for a showdown that&rsquo;s nothing short of legendary. The Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) are on the brink of scripting history, playing their 100th T20 match on this sacred cricketing ground. With an unbroken winning streak on May 18th, the stadium has become a bastion of victory for RCB, a day when they&rsquo;ve consistently turned the tide in their favor.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This season&rsquo;s narrative for RCB reads like a blockbuster movie script. After a dismal start that saw them at the bottom of the table, they&rsquo;ve surged back with a vengeance, stringing together wins that have left the fans spellbound. At the heart of this revival is the indomitable Virat Kohli, whose bat speaks a language of aggression and finesse, reminiscent of his golden run in 2016. The bowling contingent, too, has stepped up, transforming RCB into a cricketing powerhouse.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The stakes are sky-high as they face the formidable Chennai Super Kings (CSK), now under the fresh captaincy of Ruturaj Gaikwad. RCB&rsquo;s mission is clear: they need a victory, and not just any win, but one that&rsquo;s emphatic enough to elevate their Net Run Rate and secure a spot in the playoffs. They need to outclass CSK by 18 or more runs or chase a target with a minimum of 11 balls to spare. Conversely, CSK&rsquo;s equation is straightforward &ndash; a win of any margin, or even a rain-induced washout, would propel them into the playoffs, simultaneously dashing RCB&rsquo;s dreams.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As if the match itself wasn&rsquo;t thrilling enough, the weather adds a layer of intrigue, with the possibility of rain casting a shadow over the proceedings.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>With the countdown to this monumental clash underway, the anticipation is palpable. RCB&rsquo;s storied May 18th legacy and the milestone of their 100th T20 at the Chinnaswamy add an extra dimension to the drama. Will the stars align for RCB once again, or will this day mark a new chapter in their history? The stage is set, the players are ready, and the fans are waiting with bated breath for what promises to be an epic battle where glory and heartbreak are but a heartbeat away.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head In IPL:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (33)_1716039739.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestone Alert<br />\n<br />\n1- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Dinesh Karthik</span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"> </span>(299) needs one dismissal to complete 300 Dismissals in T20s.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>4- <span style=\"color:#d35400\">MS Dhoni </span>(46) needs four sixes to complete 50 sixes against RCB in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>7- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Virat Kohli</span> (2993) needs seven runs to complete 3000 IPL runs at Chinnaswamy Stadium.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>9- <span style=\"color:#d35400\">Ruturaj Gaikwad</span> (91) needs nine sixes to complete 100 sixes in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>44- <span style=\"color:#d35400\">MS Dhoni</span>(4644) needs 44 runs to surpass Suresh Raina and become the leading run scorer for CSK in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>76- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Virat Kohli </span>(7924) needs 76 runs to complete 8000 runs in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>88- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Dinesh Karthik </span>(912) needs 88 runs to complete 1000 runs for RCB in IPL.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\nVenue Stats In IPL 2024 at M.Chinnaswamy Stadium:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2024-05-18T185002_1716039824.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nPlayers Battles To Watch Out For:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for (17)_1716039888.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Danny Morrison and Deep Dasgupta:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Morrison: &quot;We are here for the blockbuster in the Garden City.

They rose to the occasion, defying the elements and the odds, to seal a win that will be remembered for ages.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The night was a symphony of cricketing drama, ending with the RCB faithful in ecstasy and CSK left to ponder what could have been.

For spinners, it was turning and gripping a little bit. I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the target we set. To sum up the season, we&rsquo;re pleased with winning seven out of 14 games. Injuries and not having Conway made a significant difference. We faced challenges right from the first game. Pathirana got injured, and we missed Fizz as well. Balancing the squad was difficult with these injuries. We couldn&rsquo;t get over the line, but these things happen. Personal milestones don&rsquo;t matter much to me; the ultimate goal is to win.

It felt like a day-five Test match in Ranchi! I&rsquo;m really proud of the contributions from many batters at good strike rates. We were defending 175, not 201 or 218! We tried to get the ball changed tonight. I dedicate the Man of the Match award to Yash Dayal! I told him pace off on this wicket was the best option.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Mumbai is marooned at the bottom of the table, teetering on the brink of replicating its 2022 fiasco. Meanwhile, LSG&#39;s chances of qualifying twinkle as faintly as a blue moon in the night sky.<br />\nThe shining star for Mumbai has been Tilak Varma, swinging his bat with seasoned consistency, while Bumrah has been bowling brilliance, slicing through line-ups with lethal precision. On the flip side, LSG&rsquo;s season skidded off track after a sprinter&#39;s start, largely due to the loss of their youthful pacer, Mayank Yadav.&nbsp;<br />\nRohit Sharma and Hardik Pandya, the dynamic duo of Mumbai, have hit a bit of a rough patch this season. But as the clock ticks down to the T20 World Cup, will these two pillars of Mumbai find their form and light up the scoreboard to turn their sputters into spectacular fireworks in time for the big dance?<br />\nAs the Mumbai Indians gear up for their lap of honor, all eyes are on the home crowd. It&rsquo;s a moment of truth at Wankhede &mdash; will it be applause or echoes of disappointment? Who will grab the glory in this Friday&#39;s thrilling showdown at Wankhede?

We&rsquo;re playing on wicket number eight, and it&rsquo;s the fourth time at this venue. The scores have been diminishing here. Remember the last match? Suryakumar Yadav chased down a brilliant hundred against the Punjab Kings, showcasing his best performance.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gavaskar: &quot;This looks like a typical Mumbai pitch. There will be plenty of runs, but the spinners will get some assistance from the little cracks present. The pitch is a bit dry, which will provide grip for the spinners. If used well, they can make an impact. Winning the toss and batting first to put pressure on the opposition seems like a good strategy.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (22)_1715954373.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Won the Toss and Elected to Bowl&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-17T194755_1715955504.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We are going to bowl first. Chasing is usually better here as the ball comes nicely in the evening.Playing for the badge and pride is crucial. It&#39;s about the character we show and playing good cricket. Winning and playing well will be appreciated.Chasing gives us more freedom to express ourselves. We don&#39;t have much to think about, just go out and play a good game of cricket.We have a couple of changes: Bumrah is out, so Arjun plays.

Despite being out of the playoff race, LSG signed off with a resounding bang, leaving a lasting impression.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Nicholas Pooran, the dynamite in LSG&rsquo;s arsenal, exploded with a blistering 75 off just 29 balls. His innings was a fireworks display, propelling LSG to a formidable total of 214/6. KL Rahul, the steady anchor, chipped in with a solid 55, setting the stage for a challenging chase.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai, eager to salvage pride, witnessed Rohit Sharma blaze away to a scintillating 68. His partnership with Dewald Brevis provided a fiery start, but LSG&rsquo;s bowling attack turned the tide. Ravi Bishnoi and Naveen-ul-Haq, the architects of MI&rsquo;s downfall, snared two wickets each. Despite Naman Dhir&rsquo;s late fireworks (62* off 28), Mumbai&rsquo;s chase fizzled out, leaving them stranded at 196/8.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rain interruptions added drama, disrupting Mumbai&rsquo;s momentum post-rain. Lucknow&rsquo;s bowlers, especially Bishnoi and Krunal Pandya, strangled the middle order, taking crucial wickets at pivotal moments. The defeat epitomized Mumbai&rsquo;s season&mdash;full of promise but lacking execution&mdash;as they finished at the bottom of the points table.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For LSG, this victory was a sweet farewell to a bitter campaign. Even though they missed the playoffs, ending the season with a win against a marquee team like Mumbai provided a much-needed morale boost. As the curtains fall on MI&rsquo;s campaign, the focus shifts to rebuilding and coming back stronger next season.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MIVSLSG_1715974221.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;It&#39;s been quite difficult.

A couple of injuries, which happen to every team, hurt us a little bit. We didn&#39;t play well enough collectively. When the bowlers had a good game, the batters didn&#39;t. We just didn&#39;t come together as much as we wanted. This is the kind of game we were looking for where the batters are scoring, and the bowlers are doing their job, but we couldn&#39;t get it together.Mayank and Yudhvir were sent to South Africa to train with our coach, Morne Morkel. They got good facilities and treatment throughout the year so they could play this season.There&#39;s not much T20 cricket coming up now. This season has taught me where I stand and how I can do better and get back into the team. My role depends on what the team needs. I&rsquo;ve done that my whole career.We would have liked Pooran to bat higher, but the senior players are better suited to absorb the pressure. When Stoinis was at number 3, we thought it was better to have the hard hitters down the order.I think I am on my father-in-law&#39;s team now, as we are cheering for Sharma ji ka beta and his team for the upcoming World Cup.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Player of the Match: </strong></span><span style=\"color:#0000cc\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nNicholas Pooran:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#0000cc\"><strong>&quot;First of all, thanks to Jesus.

The Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium sets the stage for this crucial showdown against the Gujarat Titans <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />, a team out of the race but still hungry to disrupt SRH&#39;s ascent.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The dynamics of the match are intensely competitive, especially given SRH&#39;s impeccable timing in peaking. They return rejuvenated from an eight-day hiatus, fresh off a commanding victory where they chased down 166 against the Lucknow Super Giants in under ten overs. This explosive performance has not only boosted their net run rate but has also placed them as strong contenders for a direct Qualifier 1 berth, pending outcomes from Rajasthan Royals&#39; camp.Travis Head and Abhishek Sharma have been nothing short of spectacular, with Sharma&#39;s recent 75-run blitz reasserting their dominance as openers. Their formidable partnership will be crucial against Gujarat, whose bowling attack, despite flashes of brilliance from players like Mohit Sharma, has struggled to consistently pin down opponents.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat, led by Shubman Gill, has had a season to forget, marred by inconsistent performances and strategic misfires. Despite showcasing their might with a massive 231 against Chennai Super Kings, courtesy of centuries from Gill and Sai Sudharsan, Their challenge will be to muster one last heroic effort to salvage pride and perhaps lay the groundwork for the next season.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As the titans clash in Hyderabad, it&#39;s more than just a game; it&#39;s a testament to resilience, strategy, and the sheer thrill of T20 cricket. With the playoffs just within reach, SRH looks to deliver another memorable performance, ensuring their journey continues towards the ultimate IPL glory.<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head In IPL:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (31)_1715863856.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nMilestones Alert&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/party-popper.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; :</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>1 - <span style=\"color:#d35400\">Heinrich Klaasen</span> (49) needs one four to complete 50 fours in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rashid Khan</span> (149) needs one wicket to get to 150 IPL wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1 - <span style=\"color:#d35400\">Jaydev Unadkat</span> (99) needs one wicket to get to 100 IPL Wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>4 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Wriddhiman Saha</span> (296) needs four fours to complete 300 fours in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>5 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Vijay Shankar</span> (45) needs five sixes to complete 50 sixes in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>26 - <span style=\"color:#d35400\">Aiden Markram </span>(974) needs 26 runs to complete 1000 runs in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>50 -<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> David Miller</span> (950) needs 50 runs to complete 1000 runs for GT in IPL.<br />\n<br />\nPlayers Battles To Watch Out For:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for (15)_1715863934.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>7:00 PM IST: Toss has been delayed due to Rain&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/rain.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /><img alt=\"sad\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/sad_smile.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"sad\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n7:15 PM IST: Good news, Covers are coming off and the Super Soppers are on the field doing their work&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>7:45 PM IST: We were scheduled to have the toss at 8 PM and 8.15 PM for the match to start but WAIT...

Back-to-back washouts denied them even a chance to salvage pride in their final fixtures. This concludes a disappointing season for a team that has chased both metaphorical and literal stormy clouds.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

The Royals might have already secured their playoff spot, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re taking their foot off the gas. This match is all about grabbing that coveted top-two finish and some serious bragging rights.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Royals were cruising like a maharaja on a camel, but three straight losses had them looking a little dusty. The biggest culprit? The departure of their batting main course, Jos Buttler, for the T20 World Cup. Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson, the spotlight is on you! Can you step up and fill those giant gloves? They&#39;ll need some fiery support from Riyan Parag, the season&#39;s breakout star, and the ever-reliable Dhruv Jurel. Don&#39;t forget the bowling attack! Trent Boult and Sandeep Sharma are still the strike bowlers, but Yuzvendra Chahal needs to stop leaking runs like a punctured water balloon.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Don&#39;t underestimate the wounded Kings! They may be IPL&#39;s bottom dwellers, but they&#39;ve shown flashes of brilliance with stunning knocks and nail-biting finishes. With their overseas stars, Jonny Bairstow and Sam Curran, getting ready for international duty, it&#39;s time for the domestic talent to shine. Keep an eye on the explosive batting of Prabhsimran Singh and Shashank Singh, while Arshdeep Singh needs to sharpen his death bowling skills like a diamond cutter. While technically playing away, the familiar atmosphere of Guwahati, thanks to some smart local branding by the Royals, might give them a slight home advantage. But for Punjab, this is a chance to play spoiler and potentially shake up the Royals&#39; playoff position.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Will the Royals rediscover their winning ways and secure that top spot, or will the Kings pull off a mighty upset and send shockwaves through the playoff race? The tension is thicker than a mango lassi!

Traditionally, this is a good batting surface. The dimensions are 63m to my left, 60m to my right, and 70m straight down the ground. The shortest hit for the day is the third man pocket at 54m. The average score here has been on the higher side, around 199. I&#39;m joined by WV Raman.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Raman: &quot;This pitch is made of black soil and is nicely rolled. The curator has had ample time to prepare it as this is the first game here today. We can expect the batters to score heavily and perform well.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Deep: &quot;The pitch might appear cracked, but having covered many games at Barsapara, I can assure you it plays much better than it looks. Don&#39;t be deceived by its appearance. Last season, both games here were won by the team batting first.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Raman: &quot;While setting a total and defending it is possible, remember that India vs Australia T20I here saw Australia chasing a big score successfully in the final over. So, chasing could be a viable strategy.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Deep: &quot;Ultimately, whether you bat first or second might not matter as much. The real question is, will the captain be brave enough to bat first on this surface?&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (21)_1715781450.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#ff3399\">Won the Toss and Elected to Bat&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image_1715781804.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff3399\">Sanju Samson&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We would like to bat first.

So, we&#39;re choosing to bat first.The team has been performing exceptionally well. Both our batting and bowling units are strong, and the team environment is excellent. Everyone is relaxed and focused. We understand every game in the IPL is essentially a knockout, and the pressure is constant.

While this victory might not salvage Punjab&#39;s season, it certainly stirred the playoff pot, showcasing their capacity to disrupt the leaderboard.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Dubbed the road warriors this season, the Kings excelled in enemy territory by stifling the Royals to a modest 144. Despite the sluggish pitch, Punjab&#39;s bowlers, spearheaded by a laser-sharp attack, clipped RR&#39;s wings, preventing any momentum. The chase initially appeared dire for Punjab at 48/4, but then stepped in Captain Marvel, Sam Curran. Smashing a valiant unbeaten 63, Curran navigated the choppy waters with finesse. Supported by Ashutosh Sharma, who anchored the innings, Punjab overhauled the target with seven balls to spare, sealing a five-wicket triumph.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Royals had a night marred by misfires but saw a silver lining as local hero Riyan Parag battled to a tenacious 48 off 34. Ravichandran Ashwin added some late dazzle with a rapid 28 off 19, but their efforts fell short as the bowling unit, despite Avesh Khan&#39;s 2/28 and Yuzvendra Chahal&#39;s dual strikes, failed to defend the total.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This setback leaves Rajasthan scrambling to recalibrate and secure a top-two finish, despite their assured playoff berth. Punjab, meanwhile, revels in their role as the season&#39;s spoilers, closing out with their spirits high and a resonant reminder of their potential. As the saga unfolds, the Royals are left to reflect on their stumbles, while the Kings exit stage left with a victory worth remembering.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image_1715797124.png\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>Sanju Samson&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We were expecting a better wicket.

At this critical stage of the tournament, it&#39;s about showing character and stepping up.

It&rsquo;s crunch time, folks! Both teams are hanging by a thread at 12 points, with playoff dreams dimming faster than a Delhi sunset. DC, despite the home advantage, are scrambling after a slump, while LSG, with a game in hand, are barely keeping their heads above water.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The math is merciless: just winning isn&#39;t enough. DC, reeling from a tough loss to RCB, are desperate for a major comeback and not just any win&mdash;a colossal one to stay afloat in the NRR game. With Rishabh Pant back in the saddle after a timeout, can DC ignite a late spark? Or will it be a case of too little, too late?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Over in the LSG camp, the stakes are sky-high. After a stern chat from the team owner that went viral, KL Rahul and his squad are under the scanner. Their powerplay woes and a sagging death-over run rate have been their Achilles heel. Can they turn the tables in Delhi&#39;s cauldron?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>And let&#39;s not forget LSG&#39;s net run rate. They need to not just win, but win big. Twice. Meanwhile, Jake Fraser-McGurk, DC&rsquo;s silver lining, is the only batter in IPL history with a strike rate north of 200 after facing 100 balls. Can he dazzle again and kickstart DC&#39;s mid-season resurgence narrative?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>It&#39;s a battle of nerves, strategy, and sheer will. Who will rise? Who will stumble? Get ready for a Tuesday blockbuster that promises fireworks, where every ball, every run, and every wicket could tilt the scales. Hold onto your hats, IPL fans, this one&rsquo;s going to be a thriller!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head In IPL:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (29)_1715690950.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Milestones Alert&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/explosion.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>4 -<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> KL Rahul </span>(396) needs four fours to reach 400 fours in IPL.<br />\n6 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Marcus Stoinis </span>(144) needs six fours to reach 150 fours in IPL.<br />\n9 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Krunal Pandya </span>(141) needs nine fours to reach 150 fours in IPL.<br />\n6 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Quinton de Kock </span>(994) needs six fours to reach 1000 fours in T20s.<br />\n6 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">David Warner</span> (444) needs six more fours to complete 450 fours in T20s.&nbsp;<br />\n3 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Lalit Yadav</span> (47) requires three catches to reach 50 catches in the T20 format.<br />\n<br />\nPlayers Battle To Watch Out For:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for (13)_1715691065.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report&nbsp; | Graeme Swann &amp; Murali Kartik</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Swann:</strong> &quot;One thing I can tell you straight away: it&#39;s small. We all know that it&#39;s a high-scoring ground. To my off-side, it&#39;s just 60 meters&mdash;tiny. The leg side is a bit bigger at 66 meters, and straight down the ground, it&#39;s 70 meters. There&#39;s a bit of a breeze going down the ground, so even a slight blow on the ball will send it sailing for six. This pitch, number six, is part of a square known for its high-scoring games.&quot;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kartik:</strong> &quot;Looking at this track, it has a bit of a sheen, like my head. Running my hand across it confirms that it&#39;s just a superficial grasp, with the sheen standing out. It&rsquo;s more of the same high-scoring nature we&#39;ve seen. Captains winning the toss here usually opt to bat first, given the advantage it provides. We&#39;ll see if today&#39;s captain follows suit.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (20)_1715692993.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Won The Toss and Elected to Field&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (1)_1715695611.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We are going to bowl first. This decision aligns with our team&#39;s strategy and what we believe benefits us. By bowling first, we can get into the game early and then adapt our approach. We have experienced batters who can handle the pressure, taking it off the bowlers.Our goal remains the same: we need to win two games to progress. We&#39;ve made some mistakes, but instead of dwelling on them, we need to be brave with both bat and ball, get into the contest, and focus on winning. It&#39;s about identifying what works best for the team on the day.Being brave is key. As a bowling unit, sometimes there&#39;s a hesitation to try new things. We need to bring out our skills early, stick to good lines and lengths, and keep the batters guessing.

We&#39;re not dwelling on that; we&#39;re looking forward to this match.Fielding has been a concern this season.

Getting Jake out in the first over gave us a strong start, but this season has been tough with players coming in hard even after losing wickets. Shai Hope and Porel took the momentum away from us, though we managed well at the back end. I believe 200 was a par score, and we should have chased it down.Our main issue this season has been losing too many wickets in the powerplay, preventing us from getting solid starts. This has kept players like Stoinis and Pooran from coming in with a good foundation around the 7th or 8th over.

The total was good enough, but we started the season with high hopes, only to face injuries and ups and downs. We can&#39;t complain as a franchise; we&#39;re still in playoff contention. Some things are beyond control. I missed the last game, and while I&#39;m not saying I would have won it, it would have given us a better chance.The support from the country has been heartening, especially since I was playing after a year and a half.

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>As the IPL 2024 hurtles towards a riveting climax, all eyes are locked on the Narendra Modi Stadium for a high-stakes clash. Gujarat Titans, with their backs against the wall, are all fired up to face the Kolkata Knight Riders, who are not just cruising into the playoffs but also celebrating a milestone&mdash; their 250th IPL match. It&#39;s a special night in Ahmedabad, where legends are made and dreams are either ignited or extinguished.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR, the seasoned gladiators of the league, have been the team to beat this season. With their playoff berth secured and sights set on a top-two finish, they come into the game oozing swagger and strategy. The dynamic duo of Phil Salt and Sunil Narine has been wreaking havoc at the top, turning opening overs into a blitzkrieg that&rsquo;s been nothing short of explosive. Their spin sorcerers, Narine alongside Varun Chakaravarthy, have been spinning webs around batters, setting the stage for a showdown that could well be a masterclass in T20 cricket.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat, on the other hand, are desperate to keep the playoff flame alive. With Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan wielding their willows like warriors, they&rsquo;re ready to battle it out and defy the odds.

As the IPL 2024 season approaches its climax, Royal Challengers Bangalore&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> host Delhi Capitals&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> in a crucial matchup at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium. Both teams are in a do-or-die situation, making this contest not just a game, but a potential playoff decider.RCB, after a rough start to the season, has seen a remarkable turnaround, winning their last four matches. This resurgence has been spearheaded by Virat Kohli, who returned to form with a blistering 47-ball 92 in their last game against Punjab Kings. The team&#39;s morale is high, and they are aiming to continue their winning streak to keep their playoff hopes alive. A loss here, however, would eliminate them from contention.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, DC is also in a tight spot, needing wins in their final games to secure a playoff spot. They come off a high-scoring victory over Rajasthan Royals, where their openers set up a big total, followed by a decisive bowling performance led by Kuldeep Yadav. However, DC will be without their regular captain Rishabh Pant due to a suspension, with Axar Patel stepping in as the leader for this critical game.The stakes are further complicated by the weather, with rain threatening to disrupt the game. A washout would be particularly detrimental to RCB, potentially ending their campaign, while DC could still survive but would prefer a full game to secure a win.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Both teams have their strengths lined up, with RCB possibly bringing in Glenn Maxwell or Lockie Ferguson based on the pitch and conditions, while DC might see the return of David Warner if he recovers in time from his injury. The tactical decisions, especially in the selection of the playing XI and the use of impact players, will be crucial in this high-pressure game.The matchup at the Chinnaswamy is set to be a thriller, with both teams aware that only a win can keep their playoff dreams alive. The passionate Bangalore crowd will be a significant factor, providing the home team with the extra boost needed in such a high-stakes game. As both teams gear up for this clash, the IPL sees yet another example of how the tournament&#39;s competitive nature brings out the best in teams when it matters the most.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMilestones:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Dinesh Karthik</span><span style=\"color:#0000cc\"> </span>(299) needs one Dismissal to complete 300 T20 dismissals.<br />\n6 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Faf du Plessis</span> (4494) needs six runs to complete 4500 runs in IPL.<br />\n10 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Shai Hope </span>(2490) needs 10 runs to complete 2500 runs in T20s.<br />\n103 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Virat Kohli</span> (7897) needs 103 runs to complete 8000 runs in IPL.<br />\n250- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Virat Kohli is all set to play his 250th IPL Game.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></span><br />\n<br />\nHEAD TO HEAD :-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In a total of 30 Matches , RCB have the lead winning 18 times while DC have Won 11 times with 1 game being a No-Result<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (26)_1715522286.gif\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Pitch Report:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bishop: &quot;Here we are at Match 62 of the IPL, all set to get underway. The skies are heavy today; we&#39;ve seen some raindrops earlier, and we&#39;re keeping our fingers crossed that the weather holds. We&#39;re on Pitch 8 today, which has a fascinating track record&mdash;182 was comfortably chased down here, 287 successfully defended, and just recently, RCB chased down 148 in just a few overs. Previously, this pitch was lush with live grass, but now it&#39;s been trimmed and is quite dry. Joining me is Matthew Hayden. Matthew, with the grass cut down from yesterday, how do you think this will affect the play today?&quot;<br />\n<br />\nHayden: &quot;What we&#39;re seeing is a pitch that&#39;s hard, dry, and completely devoid of grass. Previously, conditions like this really brought the quick bowlers into the game. Today, however, it seems the pacers might not have much of an advantage. This setup suggests we&#39;re in for another strong batting display. While it&#39;s uncertain if the spinners will find much grip, I&#39;m anticipating a high-scoring affair with totals possibly reaching or surpassing 190 once again.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE:&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Won the Toss and Elected to Field first</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/CSKVSRR_1715523202.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Axar Patel, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper:</span></strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;It&#39;s always a great wicket here, and considering it&#39;s a smaller ground, keeping them to a low score would be ideal. We&#39;ve discussed the importance of a strong start; that&rsquo;s always been our strategy&mdash;to hit the ground running. As you might know, Rishabh was quite upset about his ban, as the bowlers were late, yet it&#39;s the captain who faces the consequences. Despite that, he&rsquo;s assured us of his support throughout. For today&#39;s game, Kushagra will step in for Rishabh, and we&#39;ll also have Rasikh in the lineup.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Faf Du Plessis,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper:-<br />\n&quot;We would have made the same call. The pitch is showing less grass compared to before when there was more greenery. We&#39;re hoping it holds up well. At this point, every match is crucial, but we&#39;re coming in with a lot of confidence from our recent performances. Our approach is to first assess the conditions on the day and then decide when to ramp up the aggression. We really had to battle for this level of confidence early in the season, but now there&#39;s a strong sense of belief throughout the dressing room. We&#39;re fielding the same lineup for RCB today.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

It was a night where RCB&#39;s fiery bats blazed through DC&#39;s bowling, with Rajat &quot;The Rocket&quot; Patidar lighting up the scoreboard with a dazzling 52 off 32, backed by Will Jacks&#39; rapid 41 and Cameron &quot;Run Machine&quot; Green&#39;s breezy 32*. As DC tried to douse the flames, Kuldeep Yadav found himself getting smoked for 52 runs, his wickets providing scant relief. The chase was a fizzler for DC, crumbling like a burnt-out Diwali sparkler, despite Axar Patel&#39;s gritty 57. The RCB bowlers, led by Yash Dayal with a sizzling 3/20, and Lockie &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; Ferguson, turned the pitch into a graveyard of DC&#39;s hopes. The fielding was on lock, tighter than Fort Knox, snuffing out any sparks with crucial run-outs and catches. As the dust settled, the Bangalore fortress roared victorious, with the crowd&#39;s cheers echoing the fiery saga of a team refusing to back down. With this win, RCB not only spices up the points table but also sends a hot, sizzling warning to their rivals: the chase for the trophy is as heated as ever.

When you lose four wickets in the powerplay, you&#39;re always playing catch-up.The pitch was tricky, two-paced, making it difficult to hit through the line consistently.Looking ahead, anything is possible. We have a travel day tomorrow, and we&#39;ll use that time to analyze and strategize for our final group-stage match.

We&#39;ve put in great performances and there&#39;s a genuine sense of satisfaction. It all comes down to confidence, which we&#39;ve managed to find. Our batting has significantly improved, allowing us to post 200+ scores. Now, we&#39;re also seeing enhancements with the ball &mdash; taking wickets and bowling out the opposition, which is a fantastic feeling.In today&#39;s game, it wasn&#39;t so much about matchups but the conditions. The ball was swinging, which is why we used Swapnil sparingly since Axar was at the crease as well. We hope to give him more overs in the upcoming games.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Cameron Green&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Cameron Green: &quot;Yes, it was a great game for our team. Unfortunately, our strong performance came a bit late in the season, but we&#39;re still in the hunt, and that&#39;s what matters. We were initially concerned about not reaching a 200 score. However, taking early wickets was crucial, especially since the pitch was challenging. We got a bit lucky, assessed the conditions well, and executed our plans effectively. We realized that keeping the pace on the ball was beneficial for the batters, whereas taking the pace off worked better for us, particularly since there was no dew tonight. We spent a lot of time getting adjusted to these conditions. Compared to last year&#39;s pitch, which was a road, this year&#39;s pitch offers something for the bowlers, which is a welcome change. Given the short boundaries, it&#39;s good to see bowlers getting some help. I&#39;m really glad about how things turned out.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

In a pivotal IPL clash, the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) host the Rajasthan Royals (RR) at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, with high stakes for both teams. CSK, reeling from a recent loss to Gujarat Titans, find themselves in a critical position, needing victories in their remaining games to secure a playoff spot. The team&#39;s performance has been hampered by injuries and inconsistency, placing them in a precarious fourth place tied with other contenders. The previous match saw CSK&#39;s bowling lineup struggle without key pacers, allowing GT&#39;s openers to post a massive total. Despite valiant efforts from Daryl Mitchell and Moeen Ali with the bat, CSK fell short by 35 runs. This loss has intensified the pressure on MS Dhoni and his squad to deliver back-to-back wins against RR and later against Royal Challengers Bangalore to avoid playoff elimination.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, RR, led by Sanju Samson, is on the verge of securing their playoff berth. A win against CSK would not only seal their spot but also position them favorably for a top-two finish. Despite recent defeats, RR&#39;s overall campaign has been strong, marked by consistent performances from both their batsmen and bowlers. Key players for CSK in this crucial match will be their spinners, especially given the potential turn on the Chepauk pitch in an afternoon game. RR&#39;s familiarity with spin, highlighted by Ravichandran Ashwin&#39;s expertise, could play a significant role in the game&#39;s dynamics. As CSK confronts their challenges, questions linger about MS Dhoni&#39;s future in the IPL, adding an emotional layer to the encounter. This match not only holds significance for the playoff race but also could mark an end of an era if it turns out to be Dhoni&#39;s last home game.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The narrative extends beyond the field as fans anticipate a thrilling contest. With both teams desperate for a win, the stage is set for a dramatic showdown at Chepauk, where strategy, skill, and perhaps a bit of luck will determine who advances closer to the IPL playoffs.<br />\n<br />\nHead To Head :-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (27)_1715522452.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Milestones&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"kiss\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/party.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"kiss\" />&nbsp;:-<br />\n<br />\n5 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Moeen Ali</span> (95) needs five fours to complete 100 fours in the IPL.<br />\n5 - <span style=\"color:#ff33cc\">Sanju Samson</span> (395) needs five fours to complete 400 fours in IPL.<br />\n6 - <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Daryl Mitchell</span> (294) needs six fours to complete 300 fours in T20s.<br />\n8 - <span style=\"color:#ff33cc\">Yashasvi Jaiswal</span> (1492) needs eight runs to complete 1500 runs in IPL.<br />\n100 - <span style=\"color:#ff33cc\">Trent Boult is all set to play his 100th game in IPL&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBattles to Watch out for <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;:-<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for_1715507665.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report:-<br />\n<br />\nPommie Mbangwa :-<br />\nIt&#39;s a scorcher out here today! Now, there&#39;s a slight quirk to this ground with the square boundaries measuring a bit uneven&mdash;66 meters on one side and 70 meters on the other. Straight down the ground, you&#39;re looking at a 79-meter hit. The surface itself is quite bare, not a blade of grass in sight, and with this heat, it&#39;s bound to dry out as the game progresses. Daren Ganga chimes in, suggesting that any initial moisture might make the pitch a tad tacky and sticky. We do expect some turn&mdash;this pitch has shown it before. Remember, CSK have cracked the 200-mark here twice this season, so understanding and adapting to how this pitch behaves in daylight will be crucial. That&#39;s the word down here, back to you!&quot;<br />\n<br />\nDarren Ganga:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, the key factor to start with is the water content in the surface. It&#39;s critical because, as you can see, there&#39;s no grass&mdash;it&#39;s a bare pitch. I&#39;ve spoken with the curator, and he assures me that the water content is normal. But with today&#39;s heat, maintaining that moisture will be the real test, particularly as it might get a bit tacky and sticky if it dries out, which could challenge the batsmen early on. Historically, this venue has favored the spinners. We&#39;ve seen six matches here this season, and spinners have turned the ball on average 2.1 degrees more than the tournament average. So, do expect the spin to come into play significantly. Looking at the scores, the first innings average here is 183 in day games, though it dips a bit in the evening. Chennai, however, has excelled on this pitch, scoring over 200 in both games they played here at night. So, the team batting first today will likely target a similar score, aiming to set a challenging total right out of the gate.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (19)_1715507912.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#ff33cc\">Won the Toss and Elected to Bat first<br />\n&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-12T154346_1715508876.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#ff33cc\">Sanju Samson,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper:-&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff33cc\"><strong>&quot;We&#39;ve chosen to bat first today as the conditions seem favorable, with a decent wicket typical of day games and no dew expected.

As the innings edged towards the climax, Parag and Jurel cobbled together a gutsy 40-run partnership to add some respectability to the scoreboard. But just when they were getting cozy, Tushar Deshpande burst their bubble, striking twice in the final over. RR wrapped up at a modest 141/5.<br />\n<br />\nIn an innings marked by ebbs and flows, the team showcased a blend of strategic resilience and timely aggression. Ruturaj Gaikwad was the anchor, scoring a composed 42 off 41 balls, while Rachin Ravindra provided a brisk start with 27 from 18 deliveries. Shivam Dube added a rapid 18 off 11, and Sameer Rizwi&#39;s quick 15 off 8 helped propel the team to a competitive score. Key bowling contributions came from Ravichandran Ashwin, who snagged 2 crucial wickets for 35 runs, and Yuzvendra Chahal, who kept the runs in check while claiming a wicket. An unusual dismissal saw Ravindra Jadeja ruled out for obstructing the field.Yet a collecting performance from CSK emerged vitorious in their last home league game and solidify their position in league table and increse their chances of qualifying to the play-offs.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> climbs up in the table to 3rd place and delay&#39;s&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&quot;Q&quot; </span>beside<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/CSKVSRR_1715522984.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff3399\"><strong>Sanju Samson,<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper:-<br />\n&nbsp;&quot;Initially, we aimed for around 170 after observing the wicket&#39;s slow and two-paced nature during the powerplay. Unfortunately, we ended up 20-25 runs short. Simarjeet bowled exceptionally well today, adapting to the conditions better than we did. Choosing to bat first seemed favorable at this venue, but as the game progressed, the pitch played slightly better than expected, especially in the second innings. Night games here typically favor chasing due to the dew, and with the summer heat intensifying, we anticipated the pitch would slow down further&mdash;it didn&#39;t quite pan out that way. The match stretching into the 18th over highlighted the challenging batting conditions. At this stage of the tournament, it&#39;s normal to be concerned about qualifications, but our focus remains on controlling what we can and sticking to our processes. I&#39;ll be encouraging the team to keep pushing forward and aim for a better outcome in our next game.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper:-<br />\n&quot;It&#39;s a wonderful feeling to secure a win in our last home game of the league stage, especially with the incredible support from the fans. Early in the game, at 55-1, it felt like we were cruising, but cricket is unpredictable, and a couple of quick wickets can change the momentum. As a captain, my role was to anchor the innings, especially with so many stroke-players in our team. We felt comfortable throughout, with minimal pressure until the very end. Regarding the pitch, it&#39;s the kind we thrive on. It allows our spinners to come into the game, and with the boundaries being larger, hitting sixes involves a bit more risk. Our bowling strategy here is usually tailored to the conditions; we take the pace off when the pitch is slower and opt for yorkers on flatter tracks.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Simarjeet Singh, Player of the Match:-</strong><br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;I&#39;m incredibly thankful to the CSK management, our physio, and my trainer for their exceptional support during my injury. It truly feels like a blessing to be back. Regarding my bowling strategy in the middle overs, after assessing the pitch conditions, the captain and I discussed and finalized our plan. We observed how the pitch was playing, which helped us make informed decisions about our bowling approach.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), currently the table toppers, face Mumbai Indians (MI) in a match with contrasting stakes. KKR, fresh off a dominant win, seek a playoff berth on home soil, while Mumbai, already eliminated, aim to play spoilers.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR&#39;s red-hot form is a sight to behold. Openers Phil Salt and the resurgent Sunil Narine have been firing on all cylinders, setting up imposing totals. The middle order, freed from pressure, has seen Shreyas Iyer lead by example with his composed batting. Their bowling attack, spearheaded by Varun Chakaravarthy and Mitchell Starc, has been equally potent, with Starc hitting his groove at the right time.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai, despite a recent win, hasn&#39;t enjoyed a smooth season. Their batting, heavily reliant on Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan&#39;s consistency, has sputtered at times. Suryakumar Yadav, however, has been a lone warrior, recently smashing a century. Their bowling attack, though boasting Jasprit Bumrah&#39;s brilliance, lacks consistent support.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This match is a must-win for KKR. Victory not only secures a playoff spot but also bolsters their chances for a top-two finish in their final home game. For Mumbai, it&#39;s a chance to salvage pride and potentially disrupt the playoff race, offering glimpses of strategies for next season.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Eden Gardens, known for its passionate crowd, is expected to be electric. Will KKR capitalize on their home advantage and recent form to clinch a victory? Or can MI pull off an upset and add a twist to the playoff race?

The boundary dimensions are 67 meters on one side and 62 meters on the other, with a 75-meter distance straight down the ground. Given that the pitch has been under covers for a while, spinners could find some favourable conditions here, possibly getting some extra purchases. However, if the pacers aren&#39;t precise with their line and length, they could easily be hit for runs. The cool air here in Kolkata could also lead to some swing, adding another element for the bowlers to exploit.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (3)_1715441570.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Bowl first&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-11T213435_1715443534.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya&nbsp; |&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first to better understand the pitch conditions, especially since it has been covered recently.

Jasprit Bumrah, Mumbai&#39;s fiery pacer, tried his best to extinguish the KKR batting fire, but it wasn&#39;t enough.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai&#39;s chase began with promise, with their openers stitching together a 65-run partnership. Ishan Kishan, the left-handed maestro, played a swashbuckling knock of 40 off just 22 balls. However, the tide turned dramatically with the introduction of KKR&#39;s spin twins, Sunil Narine and Varun Chakaravarthy. Narine cast his spell with the dismissal of the dangerous Ishan Kishan, while Chakaravarthy tightened the noose by removing the skipper, Rohit Sharma. The run rate plummeted faster than a dropped ice cream cone!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Andre Russell, the muscle incarnate, joined the party by picking up two crucial wickets &ndash; Suryakumar Yadav and Tim David &ndash; further derailing Mumbai&#39;s chase. Chakaravarthy, the man of the moment, finished with a spellbinding 2/17, while Russell echoed his feat with a brace of his own. The pressure mounted with each passing over, and with 22 runs needed from the last over, the tension was thicker than fog in London. But young Harshit Rana, a knight in shining armor, rose to the occasion! He snatched the vital wickets of Naman Dhir and Tilak Varma early in the over, slamming the door shut on Mumbai&#39;s hopes and sealing a glorious victory for KKR.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This win wasn&#39;t just a ticket to the playoffs; it also solidified KKR&#39;s claim for a top-two finish, thanks to their superior net run rate.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-12T005339_1715455538.png\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;Our batting foundation was initially solid, but we failed to capitalize and maintain momentum, which ultimately cost us. The pitch was a bit inconsistent and slightly tacky, making it essential to keep the momentum going. Despite the challenging conditions, I think our bowlers performed well. It&#39;s notable that most of the boundaries were hit towards the wet covers area.Looking ahead to our last game, honestly, my approach is simple: just go out there, enjoy the game, and ensure we continue to play good cricket. That&rsquo;s been my philosophy from the start. This season, we haven&#39;t played as well as we could have.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Before the game, I had a strong feeling we would qualify. Despite the nerves, we&#39;ve been playing excellent cricket, with many players stepping up as game changers&mdash;today was a prime example. Even though we lost the toss, our performance proved we could win from any situation. The team&#39;s comeback after the powerplay in the first innings was a tremendous effort.I don&#39;t dwell on past records; each day is a new opportunity. Despite the challenging weather, we finished strong. It&rsquo;s not always about who is the best; it&rsquo;s about who performs well on the day. Facing Varun in the nets yesterday was tough; his leg-spin was difficult to handle. I trusted my instincts to go with Varun today, and he delivered brilliantly.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nPlayer of the Match:&nbsp;Varun Chakaravarthy</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Varun Chakaravarthy: &quot;Taking Rohit Sharma&#39;s wicket was special; I had never dismissed him before, so the celebration was inevitable. The wicket helped, and I utilized it to encourage him to play across the line.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Narine and I discuss tactics often. Though we&#39;re similar tactically, our techniques differ; Narine bowls from in front of the hand, while I use the back of my hand.&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Playing at Eden Gardens, known for its small boundaries and initially flat pitches, has been a challenge. My approach hasn&#39;t changed since the start of the season, but the results are just starting to show now.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>The pressure cooker&#39;s cranked up to eleven in the IPL as the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) lock horns with the Gujarat Titans (GT) in Ahmedabad! CSK, currently chilling at number four, need a win to keep their playoff dreams on a simmer. But for GT, languishing at the bottom of the table, this is a do-or-die clash &ndash; a win or their IPL journey goes up in smoke.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite their recent win against Punjab Kings, CSK&#39;s batting hasn&#39;t exactly been firing on all cylinders. While skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad has been a rock at the top, the rest of the top order, particularly Ajinkya Rahane, has been as consistent as a wobbly internet connection. Guys like Daryl Mitchell and Ravindra Jadeja will need to step up and become the middle-order anchors CSK desperately needs. But hey, on the bright side, their bowling attack has been a revelation! Even with key pacers Matheesha Pathirana and Mustafizur Rahman out injured, the rise of Tushar Deshpande and Jadeja&#39;s experience with the ball could put a serious dent in GT&#39;s batting plans.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>GT, on the other hand, come into this match with their backs against the wall. They&#39;ve been on a three-match losing streak, and their bowling attack has been about as effective as a wet firecracker. Their batting has shown flashes of brilliance with David Miller and Shahrukh Khan, but overall, it&#39;s been a patchy performance. But here&#39;s the thing: when a team has nothing to lose, they can be a real handful. Skipper Shubman Gill will be looking to prove his captaincy mettle and lead from the front. They might even pull a rabbit out of the hat and unleash some unexpected bowling heroes.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK has a clear psychological edge, having won their last three encounters against GT, including the IPL 2023 final. But cricket, as they say, is a funny game, and past performance doesn&#39;t guarantee future success. Plus, CSK needs to keep an eye on their positive net run rate.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This clash promises to be a spicy battle between a team desperate to stay alive (GT) and another determined to solidify their playoff spot (CSK). CSK&#39;s batting form and GT&#39;s bowling woes are the key areas to watch. While CSK might be the favourites on paper, GT&#39;s unpredictable nature with their backs against the wall adds a layer of delicious uncertainty. Get your popcorn ready, folks, because this high-pressure encounter is guaranteed to be a nail-biter!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head In IPL:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (24)_1715347167.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stats At Ahmedabad in IPL 2024:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2024-05-10T185256_1715347398.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones Alert</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1- <span style=\"color:#d35400\">Shivam Dube </span>(99) needs one maximum to complete 100 sixes in IPL<br />\n2- <span style=\"color:#d35400\">MS Dhoni</span>(248) needs two sixes to complete 250 sixes in IPL.<br />\n3- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rashid Khan</span> (147) needs three wickets to complete 150 wickets in the IPL.<br />\n4- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Wriddhiman Saha</span> (296) needs four fours to complete 300 fours in IPL.<br />\n5- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Vijay Shankar </span>(45) needs five sixes to complete 50 IPL Sixes.<br />\n9- <span style=\"color:#d35400\">Moeen Ali </span>(91) needs nine fours to complete 100 fours in IPL.<br />\n66- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Wriddhiman Saha </span>(2934) needs 66 runs to complete 3000 runs in IPL.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nPLAYER BATTLES TO WATCH OUT FOR<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for (2)_1715349477.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report | Nick Knight &amp; Chris Morris:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Knight: &quot;It&#39;s truly amazing to stand here in the middle of Narendra Modi Stadium, such an iconic venue.

The Titans piled on a mammoth 231 runs, a total that felt insurmountable from the outset.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>CSK&#39;s chase resembled a horror show from the get-go. A first-over run-out set the wrong tone, and early dismissals of Rahane and Gaikwad left them reeling. While Mitchell and Ali fought valiantly with fifties, the CSK middle order simply couldn&#39;t handle the GT bowling attack.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mohit Sharma emerged as the hero, snuffing out CSK&#39;s hopes with a crucial triple-wicket spell. Rashid Khan, back to his mesmerizing best, picked up key wickets in the death overs, ensuring MS Dhoni&#39;s unbeaten 26 remained a mere consolation.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This win is a shot in the arm for the Titans. They addressed their weaknesses, dominated with both bat and ball, and announced their return to the playoff race in emphatic fashion. CSK, despite the setback, are still in a decent position, but their inconsistencies need to be ironed out if they want to be serious contenders.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The IPL is wide open, folks! Every match is a nail-biter, and this win by the Titans throws the playoff picture wide open. Buckle up, cricket fans, because the race to the top four is about to get intense!&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-11T000525_1715366145.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad |&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Our fielding wasn&#39;t quite up to the mark today, and while our execution was still decent, they played some extraordinary shots and put pressure on us from the very first over.

We didn&#39;t set a specific target but aimed to maximize every opportunity presented to us.Our team has great camaraderie. We excel at running between the wickets, hitting gaps, and taking twos. We&#39;ve batted together since last year, which has really built our understanding.This partnership is arguably the best opening duo GT has had. Mohit has been exceptional over the past few years, both with his bowling and batting. Though he&rsquo;s had a couple of off games, that happens to everyone. With a few games left, I&rsquo;m confident we can turn things around.We could have reached 250 today; we were about 10-15 runs short. In the final overs, they bowled well, which affected our net run rate going forward.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

With both teams on the brink of elimination, this contest is expected to be a thrilling showcase of strategy and skill.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>RCB, led by Faf du Plessis, has seen a dramatic turnaround, securing three consecutive wins thanks to strong performances from both bowlers and batsmen. Du Plessis has been instrumental, exemplified by his explosive 63 off 23 balls against Gujarat Titans, setting a high pace for the team. The bowlers, including Mohammed Siraj and Yash Dayal, have also stepped up, tightening their game at crucial moments.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>PBKS, however, has struggled with consistency, despite showing potential in high-stakes games, like their record chase against Kolkata Knight Riders. The team has leaned heavily on talents such as Shashank Singh, but the experience of Jonny Bairstow remains key to their success.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This match is more than just a game; it&#39;s a test of nerve and strategy with playoff implications. RCB aims to leverage their aggressive batting approach, which has significantly improved their scoring rate, especially in the powerplays. PBKS, on the other hand, needs to tighten their death bowling to curb their opponents&#39; scoring.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As the IPL 2024 heads towards its climax, this encounter promises not just T20 action but a dramatic battle for survival, making it a must-watch for every cricket fan.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones Alert</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Dinesh Karthik</span> (299) needs one Dismissal to complete 300 Dismissals in T20s.<br />\n1- <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Shashank Singh</span> (49) needs one six to complete 50 sixes in T20s.<br />\n6- <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sam Curran </span>(144) needs six maximums to complete 150 sixes in T20s.<br />\n15- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Faf du Plessis </span>(4485) needs 15 runs to complete 4500 runs in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head In IPL:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (1)_1715262178.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>Pitctch Report |&nbsp;Darren Ganga&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&quot; We&#39;re back on the same pitch used for the PBKS vs. CSK match. The boundaries measure 64 m to the off side, 62 m to the leg side, and 75 m straight down.The pitch sports a bit more grass than usual today, showing a tinge of green, but it&#39;s still dry and hard. Historically, the average first innings score for night matches here is 195. Batters typically find it tough to time the ball during the powerplay due to the extra bounce and something in the pitch for the fast bowlers. Spin could also be influential; accurate bowling can be quite effective on this surface. While it&#39;s a good batting wicket, there&#39;s a better balance with opportunities for bowlers too. Aiming for around 190 can set up a strong chance for a win.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (4)_1715262198.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Punjab Kings won the toss and opt to bowl first.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-09T193551_1715263674.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sam Curran <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;We&#39;re bowling first.

This win not only reignited RCB&#39;s playoff hopes but extinguished PBKS&#39;s flickering flame.<br />\nFaf du Plessis provided a quick early cameo for RCB before being dismissed by debutant Vidhwath Kaverappa. But the spotlight belonged to the evergreen Virat Kohli. Gifted a couple of early lifelines, Kohli feasted on the bowling attack, composing a scintillating 92 off a mere 47 balls. Seven boundaries and six towering sixes peppered his innings, leaving the PBKS bowlers shell-shocked. Kohli wasn&#39;t a one-man show. Rajat Patidar and Cameron Green provided crucial support, anchoring vital half-century partnerships. Their collective efforts propelled RCB to a staggering 241/7, rewriting the record books for the highest T20 score at the Dharamsala stadium.<br />\nPBKS&#39;s chase sputtered from the start with Prabhsimran Singh departing early. A brief flicker of hope emerged with a 65-run stand between Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Rossouw (who smashed a fiery 61 off 27 balls). However, the RCB bowling attack, orchestrated by the crafty Karn Sharma and the fiery Mohammed Siraj, tightened the screws. Swapnil Singh&#39;s early breakthrough and Sharma&#39;s strategic bowling in the middle overs choked the flow of runs. PBKS&#39;s middle order, unable to handle the pressure, crumbled like a sandcastle, eventually falling short by a massive 60 runs.<br />\nThis comprehensive victory not only highlighted RCB&#39;s balanced performance but also exposed PBKS&#39;s inconsistency. While RCB marches forward with renewed momentum and a playoff berth within reach, PBKS heads back to the drawing board after another disappointing season. The night in Dharamsala belonged to RCB, a night where Kohli&#39;s brilliance and the bowling unit&#39;s collective effort outshone a spirited but ultimately outmatched PBKS side.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/PBKSVSRCB_1715281090.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sam Curran <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; Skipper : &quot;It&#39;s slightly frustrating and obviously disappointing.

I focus on practising less but improving specific skills. I introduced the slog sweep without much practice because I aim to find gaps and maintain a strong strike rate in the middle overs. Honesty is key. We were not up to mark in the first half of the tournament. A crucial team discussion in Kolkata turned things around. We&#39;ve improved, especially in bowling, and the momentum has carried us since. We strive to make our fans proud and elevate our game. Although we&#39;re on a roll, we still depend on other outcomes, which is disappointing. We&#39;d rather not rely on other results, but that&#39;s the current situation. Thank you.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

However, its fame remains. It&#39;s a central pitch today, which means there are no notably short boundaries; they are all roughly in the mid-sixties, varying by just a few meters, and the straight hit is particularly long. This setup favors spinners, who will appreciate the relatively larger boundary dimensions.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nHayden: &quot;We&#39;re at the peak of the Indian summer, and Hyderabad feels like a clay oven today&mdash;extremely hot and dry. The pitch itself is hard and has begun showing tiny cracks. I doubt we&#39;ll see a record score today. It looks like a pitch where 200 runs is feasible, thanks to a very fast outfield and minimal dew expected tonight. Fast bowlers will likely use their cutters effectively, particularly in the middle overs. Bowlers like Natarajan can exploit these conditions well, especially towards the end of an innings.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (17)_1715176003.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Won the Toss and Elected to Bat first&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-08T194157_1715177539.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We&#39;ll bat first.

We&#39;ve occasionally seen this type of batting on TV, but what we witnessed today was simply surreal. Every hit seemed perfectly executed. Truly, a testament to their exceptional skill.They&#39;ve clearly worked incredibly hard on their six-hitting abilities, and it showed today. They didn&rsquo;t even let us assess the pitch in the second innings; they were just relentless from the start.The pitch itself didn&#39;t change much, but facing batters with such fearless intent, who connect from the first ball, poses a significant challenge. The only strategy to counter such aggression is to take early wickets during the powerplay. Unfortunately, we couldn&rsquo;t manage that today.After a loss, it&#39;s natural for decisions to be scrutinized. We fell short by 40-50 runs. Losing early wickets prevented us from building a strong innings, though Ayush and Nicky did well to help us reach 166.

They were unstoppable. I let them play their game; they&#39;re both incredibly positive and skilled. As a bowler, it&#39;s challenging to control such aggression, especially with limited outfield protection. Travis&#39;s extraordinary hitting isn&#39;t surprising anymore. He&#39;s unconventional but effective, consistently finding the bat&#39;s middle.&nbsp;I hadn&#39;t seen much of him(Abhishek Sharma) before, but he&#39;s shown he&#39;s formidable against both seam and spin, playing with remarkable freedom.Par scores are rising due to good wickets and limited fielding restrictions.&nbsp;We were confident but finishing the game in just 9.4 overs was unexpected. We love the home-ground advantage, but today was something special.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match: <span style=\"color:#d35400\">Travis Head&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTravis Head : &quot;It&#39;s been thrilling to bat with Abhi. My focus has been on good positioning and reacting quickly to the ball. I caught a rhythm early and aimed to exploit the powerplay. I&#39;ve been honing my skills against spin, important for upcoming matches in the Caribbean and the World Cup. My coaches encourage the same aggressive approach, especially in the powerplay, and I aim to maintain this consistency to contribute to the team.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

With the pitch in Delhi proving to be a goldmine for batsmen this season, spectators can brace themselves for another high-voltage encounter.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Delhi Capitals, currently in a precarious sixth place, have shown flashes of brilliance but remain inconsistent. The dynamism of Jake Fraser-McGurk,combined with the power plays of Rishabh Pant and Tristan Stubbs, has been central to their strategy. On the other side, the Rajasthan Royals have exhibited a more robust form, anchored by their pacers who have been the most economical in the league with an average of 23.57. Their top-order has been prolific, despite some hiccups in the lower-middle order. The experience of their spinners and a formidable new-ball attack could be key in stifling DC&#39;s aggressive batting lineup.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Previous encounters this season saw the Royals narrowly edging out the Capitals, with a 12-run victory in Jaipur. Delhi&rsquo;s middle order struggled in that game, and they will be keen to address this in the upcoming match.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Both teams have had their share of injuries and last-minute player assessments, which could play a crucial role in their strategies. For DC, the return of Ishant Sharma might bolster their bowling, while RR would hope their consistent lineup continues to deliver, particularly with Jos Buttler expected to bring his A-game.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>As the Delhi sun sets, the stage is set for a clash that could either reignite the Capitals&rsquo; hopes or seal a playoff berth for the Royals. With their backs against the wall, Delhi would need to harness the home advantage and break free from the shackles of inconsistency. Meanwhile, Rajasthan, looking to reclaim the top spot, will bank on their disciplined bowling and explosive batting to carry the day.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Who will seize the moment under the lights of the IPL&#39;s grand amphitheatre?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in IPL:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (23)_1715090100.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\nMilestones Alert&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/explosion.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />:<br />\n<br />\n1 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#ff0099\">Yuzvendra Chahal </span>(349) needs one scalp to get to 350 wickets in T20s<br />\n1 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#ff0099\">Sanju Samson</span> (199) needs one maximum to complete 200 sixes in IPL.<br />\n1 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Axar Patel </span>(99) needs one four to complete 100 fours in IPL.<br />\n9 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rishabh Pant </span>(291) needs nine fours to complete 300 fours in IPL.<br />\n12 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#ff0099\">Yashasvi Jaiswal </span>(1488) needs 12 runs to complete 1500 runs in IPL.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#16a085\">Pitch Report</span> | Deep Dasgupta &amp; Brian Lara :</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Deep: &quot;Believe it or not, the average score here is 249, with five out of six innings topping 200. The ground&#39;s small dimensions are a big factor. To my right, the boundary is just 59 meters, and behind me, the shortest side is only 53 meters. The longest stretch on my left reaches 67 meters, and it&#39;s 75 meters towards mid-wicket.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nLara: &quot;The pitches initially had more grass, which masked the cracks. Now, more bare patches and cracks are visible. There&#39;s still a grass strip in the middle, but pitching up isn&#39;t effective as the ball slides under the bat. Bowlers should aim for a consistent good length. The pitch conditions seem secondary to how the batters are playing; another high-scoring game is likely.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nDeep: &quot;High scores are common here, and today should be similar, though slightly lower due to less grass. Talking with the curator, Ankit, he mentioned minimal dew lately.

A rate of 12 runs per over on this pitch was achievable, but that&#39;s the unpredictable nature of the IPL. We felt that 220 was about 10 runs too many. We managed to regain some control but conceded a few too many runs towards the end.&quot;We&#39;ve lost three very close games now. The key for us is to continue making slight adjustments. There&#39;s hardly any downtime in this tournament. Stubbs has adapted well to the conditions and batted brilliantly. He specifically went after our best bowlers, Yuzi Chahal and Sandeep Sharma, adding those crucial 20-30 extra runs that ultimately tipped the scales.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;The way our bowlers performed towards the end was the highlight for us and was very encouraging to see. We aim to learn from every game, irrespective of the outcome, and continue moving forward. Kuldeep&#39;s performance was particularly pleasing. We felt that keeping them to 200 was a reasonable target, and that guided our strategy.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Kuldeep Yadav&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Kuldeep Yadav | Player of the Match: &quot;Bowling a good length is crucial, especially during the death overs. Having played against Ferreira in South Africa, I knew he favored the back foot. I aimed to keep my deliveries full and quick, which worked as I got him out on the first ball. I also threw in a couple of seam-up deliveries to gauge the batters&#39; responses. It&#39;s all about the length, and sticking to that was my plan. Scoring over 200 puts pressure on bowlers but also presents opportunities for wickets, and I focused on playing to my strengths and maintaining belief.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Their batting needs a spark, especially at the top. Quinton de Kock&#39;s return is a sigh of relief, but all eyes will be on the in-form Marcus Stoinis, who&#39;s been a superhero with back-to-back winning knocks. Deepak Hooda and Nicholas Pooran add muscle to the middle order, but the loss of Mayank Yadav weakens their bowling. Spin wizard Amit Mishra might just weave his magic on this Lucknow turner.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR, on the other hand, are riding a wave. Their batting boasts explosiveness at the top with Phil Salt and Sunil Narine, while Shreyas Iyer and Venkatesh Iyer hold the fort in the middle. Rinku Singh will be looking to hit a big one before the World Cup.&nbsp; Their bowling attack is equally fiery, with Mitchell Starc leading the pace and the spin twins, Varun Chakaravarthy and Narine, bamboozling batsmen.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Lucknow pitch is known to be bowler-friendly, so don&#39;t expect a run-fest. Chasing can be a tricky proposition here as well, adding another layer of drama to this Sunday night showdown. Will LSG&#39;s batting find its mojo and emerge victorious, or will KKR continue their rampage and solidify their playoff spot? Buckle up, IPL fam, because this clash promises fireworks!<br />\n<br />\nHead-To-Head In IPL:<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (21)_1714915212.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report: &quot;A gentle breeze around the ground. This venue is one of the bigger grounds. Straight down the ground is 76m, square boundaries - 68m and 61m respectively. The dimensions will make a bit of a difference, we&#39;ve seen the ball into the surface being used particularly with one side bigger than the other right throughout this tournament. When we come to the wicket, this is the third time that this surface is being used. There&#39;s a hint of green grass on it, but there are some bare red patches. We expect it to slow down a little bit more than it might have in the past. Anywhere around that, 190-200 will be a good score batting first</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> has won the toss and have elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-05T195700_1714919300.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: We will field.

Batting first, Kolkata Knight Riders set a formidable target of 235 runs for the loss of 6 wickets in their allotted 20 overs. Narine and Salt came out all guns blazing smashing 61 from just 26 balls. Salt accounted for 32 off 14 deliveries, while Narine top scored with 81 from just 39 deliveries. A late surge of 25 at a strike rate of 416 from Ramandeep helped KKR reach a huge total of 235.

When you are chasing a big score, you go too hard and that sometimes backfires. We lost too many wickets while looking to go after everything. &nbsp;Just a poor performance overall. We didn&#39;t hit our lengths consistently, just had a poor performance overall with bat, ball and in the field. It&#39;s clear, if we want to get to the top four, we have to win all four matches. That will give us a little bit of freedom to go out there and be a little bit more fearless, a little bit brave to take on the game&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />Skipper: &quot; We are losing tosses but we are winning games that what matters. We had a great start in the powerplay thanks to Salty and Sunil. A lefty-righty combination makes thing difficult for the opposition. It&#39;s all about the freedom, to go out and express themselves. Going with a positive intent sometimes works and sometimes it does not. &nbsp;They are setting us up and giving us momentum and no matter what the situation is, we are playing with a positive mindset.

The Chepauk drubbing still stings for CSK, and their top order, particularly Ajinkya Rahane, needs to find some form pronto. Ruturaj Gaikwad&#39;s flying form is a saving grace, but questions linger about their middle-overs mojo. Injuries haven&#39;t helped their bowling attack either, leaving them a tad patchy.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, PBKS are buzzing after their record run-chase and a convincing win over CSK. Jonny Bairstow&#39;s hot bat is a welcome addition to their batting line-up, while their bowling, especially the death bowling, seems to be plugging the leaks. This is a team on a roll, high on confidence and enjoying a bit of home advantage.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>So, can CSK bounce back and exact revenge, or will the in-form Punjab Kings continue their rampage? The answer hinges on a few key areas: Can CSK batsmen like Shivam Dube translate their practice nets pyrotechnics into match-winning knocks? Will the afternoon Dharamsala negate the dew factor that hampered CSK in Chennai? And lastly, will Punjab&#39;s youthful exuberance trump CSK&#39;s experience in this clash of momentum versus pedigree?

Ruturaj Gaikwad and Daryl Mitchell set a fiery pace, scoring at 10 runs per over in the powerplay, laying a solid foundation for the middle overs. However, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;struck back with a double blow, removing Gaikwad and Shivam Dube off consecutive deliveries, shifting the momentum in their favour. CSK struggled against the mesmerizing spell of Rahul Chahar, finding themselves unable to counter his crafty bowling. Ravindra Jadeja&#39;s aggressive knock of 43 runs from 26 deliveries emerged as a silver lining in CSK&#39;s innings, helping them reach a competitive total of 167.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In response, PBKS faced an early setback losing Jonny Bairstow and Rilee Roussow in the second over, courtesy of some fiery bowling from Deshpande, who showcased his prowess with the new ball. The introduction of Jadeja further compounded PBKS&#39;s woes, as the left-arm spinner picked up three crucial wickets for just 20 runs in his four overs, putting a halt to any hopes of a PBKS comeback. Despite a valiant effort from their middle order, PBKS kept losing wickets at regular intervals, ultimately falling short by 8 runs in their first contest at Dharamshala. The match showcased a display of thrilling cricket, with both teams giving their all, but it was CSK who emerged victorious in the end.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/CSKVSPBKS_1714917899.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sam Curran, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; Thought we bowled well.

Everyone seems to think it&#39;s good to lose the toss, but honestly, it matters to me. We initially thought we could push for a higher score like 180-200 given the start we had, but consecutive wickets fell, and we adjusted our target to 160-170, which felt slightly short. However, given how the pitch played later, it seemed just about par.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Talking about Simarjeet&#39;s performance, he&#39;s really picked up pace, hitting around 150s in pre-season, though he didn&rsquo;t get many chances earlier with Deepak, Shardul, Tushar, Pathirana, and Fizz around. It&#39;s great that he got to play today. We considered an impact batter but opted for a bowler, thinking a good spell might secure more for us than a few quick runs.Overall, it&rsquo;s a huge relief to win, especially with all the injuries we&#39;ve had. This morning, we weren&#39;t even sure who would play, so I&#39;m really happy with how things turned out.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match :-</strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong> Ravindra Jadeja :</strong></span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>&quot;The pitch for today&#39;s game was slow, which was pretty much anticipated due to the heat affecting it during this day game. In terms of our batting, we started strong in the powerplay but struggled to maintain momentum due to a lack of partnerships in the middle overs. I was aiming to establish a solid partnership to set up for a strong finish. As for our bowling, our pacers delivered upfront during the powerplay, with Tushar snagging two crucial wickets, and then Mitch and I managed to contain the opposition in the middle overs. Although the pitch appeared flat initially, it became challenging to play as the ball aged and didn&#39;t come onto the bat as expected. This being a new venue, it was tricky to predict the amount of turn or stoppage. We felt we were short by about 15-20 runs, but thankfully, our disciplined bowling in the powerplay and middle overs kept us in the game. My role as a batter is to anchor and build innings, looking to accelerate towards the end. However, when we lose early wickets, it&#39;s challenging to regain momentum, which is critical in matches that we eventually win.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. In their recent encounter,&nbsp;Bengaluru outshone Gujarat by chasing down 201 runs with four overs to spare, a victory propelled by Will Jacks&#39; explosive batting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Coming into this match, RCB rides a wave of momentum, having secured back-to-back victories following a narrow one-run defeat against KKR. Positioned tenth in the standings with 6 points from ten games, RCB faces a must-win situation in every match remaining to keep their playoff hopes alive. Their recent performances have shown a timely peaking of form from both batters and bowlers, setting the stage for a spirited continuation of their winning streak.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans, conversely, have encountered a rough patch this season, marked by a series of losses that have left them in a precarious eighth position with eight points from ten games. The team urgently needs victories to bolster their chances of advancing in the tournament. Despite Shubman Gill&#39;s underperformance relative to expectations, Sai Sudharsan has been a standout, amassing over 400 runs including two consecutive fifties. Faced with critical upcoming matches, Gujarat is under pressure to regroup and reclaim their form.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>As both teams prepare for this crucial encounter, the stakes couldn&#39;t be higher, with each side desperate to secure a win to keep their playoff aspirations viable. Will RCB continue their resurgence, or will Gujarat find their footing and turn their fortunes around?

Expect some big hits.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Hayden: &quot;Surface looks hard, a bit parched, but it&#39;ll shine up nicely for batting. Batsmen love the trusty bounce here, making it easy to find boundaries. Spinners might struggle with grip, but overall, it&#39;s a high-scoring ground.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Bishop: &quot;I&#39;ll stay neutral on the dew factor, given yesterday&#39;s rain.

This crucial encounter finds both teams at pivotal moments in their campaigns.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai Indians find themselves in a precarious position, ranked ninth with just six points from ten matches. Despite facing consecutive defeats, MI still has a slim mathematical chance to qualify for the playoffs, provided they win all remaining matches by substantial margins and other results go their way. A loss in this match, however, would officially eliminate them from playoff contention. The team has relied heavily on Tilak Varma, who has consistently stepped up to anchor the batting, while Jasprit Bumrah has been a standout in the bowling department, excelling in both wicket-taking and maintaining a low economy rate. However, concerns about the form of their captain, who has had a disappointing IPL season, remain a significant challenge. Mumbai Indians are eager to turn their fortunes around and rekindle their winning ways.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kolkata Knight Riders come into this game riding high after a commanding win over Delhi Capitals, thanks to a stellar bowling performance by Sunil Narine and Varun Chakaravarthy. Prior to this victory, KKR experienced two tough losses against PBKS and RR, where they posted substantial totals but failed to secure wins. Positioned second in the table with 12 points from nine games, KKR is looking to solidify their playoff position with a couple more wins.

The boundary sizes vary, with the shorter square boundary measuring 60 meters to my right and 65 meters to the left. Down the ground, it&#39;s 74 meters. Overall, the pitch looks conducive to good cricket.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Michael Clarke: &quot;From this end, the pitch appears dry, which could favour spin bowling. However, there&#39;s potential for pace and bounce from the other end due to the even grass covering. Winning the toss will be crucial, especially with the expected dew. Both teams have their strengths, with Mumbai relying on their quicks and KKR favouring spinners. We can expect a high-scoring game with good batting conditions.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (1)_1714743515.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-05-03T193816_1714745314.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We&#39;ve chosen to bowl first, playing for our pride.

We struggled to build partnerships and kept losing wickets, which is always costly in T20 cricket. As for the questions surrounding our performance, well, there&#39;s a lot to analyze, but it&#39;ll take some time to find those answers. But for now, not much to say. Our bowlers, though, did a fantastic job. The pitch got better after the first innings, and the dew factor came into play. We&#39;ll review the game and identify areas where we could have done better.In times like these, I always remind myself to keep fighting. You can&#39;t give up, even when the going gets tough.

Winning here at Wankhede after 12 years is truly special. We would have loved to savor this victory longer, but with another game in two days, our focus shifts to recovery. The impact rule played a crucial role in this game. Manish is a talented player, and it was great to see him build a partnership with Venky. All I had to tell the bowlers was that if we set a good total, we could defend it. The spinners were exceptional, executing our plans perfectly. Venkatesh Iyer&#39;s knock was fantastic. He&#39;s been eager to showcase his abilities, and today, he played beautifully. I&#39;m happy for him.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<strong>Player of the Match : <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Venkatesh Iyer&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Venkatesh Iyer | Player of Match: &quot;Being adaptable is key in professional cricket, so I wanted to play a flexible role. Since I was hitting the ball well, I decided to anchor the innings, and it worked out nicely. This was the 4th or 5th time Manish was padded up, and finally, he got to bat today, all thanks to the impact player rule. It was beneficial to send someone like Manish to anchor the innings before Russell and Ramandeep. Throughout the innings, Manish guided me, offering insights on which bowlers to take on and which situations to handle. He&#39;s an experienced campaigner, and his mentorship was invaluable. Being a smarter cricketer allows you to make better decisions. While I could have taken on Piyush Chawla or any other seamer, I chose to play according to the situation. I&#39;m a huge fan of Dada so I sought his advice on my stance and position, which worked out well for me. It was a fruitful conversation with him.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

As the tournament progresses, both teams are poised to deliver a captivating performance.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Rajasthan Royals are riding high, leading the points table with eight wins from nine matches. A victory in this upcoming game would clinch their playoff berth, a testament to their dominant run this season. The team&#39;s success has been significantly aided by the stellar performance of their top four batters, who have consistently made valuable contributions. Additionally, their bowling attack has been formidable, with Yuzvendra Chahal reaching a personal milestone of 200 IPL wickets, underscoring the strength of RR&#39;s bowling lineup. With high confidence and momentum on their side, the Royals are looking to extend their winning streak.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, Sunrisers Hyderabad has shown impressive batting prowess throughout the season, marked by aggressive power hitting from the top and middle order. For the first time, they have surpassed 100 sixes in the IPL, with Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, and Heinrich Klaasen leading the charge. However, after a strong start to the season, two consecutive losses have slightly derailed their campaign, placing them in fifth position with 10 points.

The square boundaries are 61m and 64m while the pockets around are 70m, it is only 60m behind the wicket and down the ground is 73m. good track to bat on and there will be assistance for the turners. Pacers will enjoy bounce &amp; carry because of the hardness of the surface but one can also expect lots of runs. SRH if they play the way they do You can be pretty certain that you&#39;ll get a score of 250 unless Rajasthan Royals pull out some magic tricks.

The pair of Gaikwad and Rahane accumulated 55 in the powerplay going over 9 r.p.o. But the team lost momentum in the middle over phase where the team lost 3 wickets without a single boundary hit. Gaikwad top scored with 62 in CSK&#39;s below-par score of 162. The spin duo of Brar and Rahul Chahar picked two wickets each giving nothing away to the CSK batters.

The pitch got better later on and was not the best when we were batting. So I feel we were well short of the score that would put PBKS under pressure. &nbsp;To be honest, I&#39;m under pressure when I go to the middle for the toss. I think the last two games, the conditions suited us better and the pitch was suitable as well, giving us a chance to fight hard and get to 200-plus score. Today, it wasn&#39;t the track to even get 180. It&#39;s a real problem when players miss out due to injuries and Chahal walking away in the first over did not help our cause either. It is difficult when you have only two bowlers, the dew took the spinners out of the equation as well. It was tough, but there&#39;re four games left and we will try and come back to winning ways.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sam Curran, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &nbsp;Very happy with the way things went. Every time you come to Chennai and take two wins, always a special feeling. &nbsp;We are in a position where we need to win all our games, we come up against the same opposition in a few days. We come against the same opposition so we have one up on them. It is a new game, new conditions but this win will give us a lot of confidence. I think our bowlers were superb, the spinners and Jonny striking them well, even the way we paced that chase, it was brilliant. Need to build on that confidence&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Harpreet Brar is Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Harpreet Brar: &quot; &nbsp; It was a good track to bowl on, and even Rahul Chahar bowled well. I have been playing for last 6 years, so my confidence has been pretty high. Now bowling to these legends of the game like MS Paji and all it feels normal, I just bowl to my strengths. To be honest, I don&#39;t think wickets, my aim is only to bowl lots of dot balls and dot balls create the wickets. When there is spin in the wicket, the bowlers&#39; confidence goes up and it is a bit helpful.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Both teams are looking to recover from recent losses and regain their footing in the competition.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Super Giants, currently fifth in the standings with 10 points from nine games, faced a setback in their last match against the table-topping Rajasthan Royals. As they seek to return to their winning ways, LSG will lean on their top performers: KL Rahul, who leads their batting lineup with 378 runs from nine games, and Nicholas Pooran, who follows with 291 runs at a striking rate of 165.34. Yash Thakur, with 10 wickets, leads their bowling attack, supported by Mohsin Khan, who has taken seven wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Meanwhile, Mumbai Indians come into this match after suffering consecutive losses, placing them second from the bottom of the table with just six points from nine games. With their playoff hopes hanging by a thread, MI needs a strong comeback. Key players like Tilak Varma and Rohit Sharma, who have scored 336 and 311 runs respectively, will be crucial for their resurgence. The bowling unit is anchored by Jasprit Bumrah, who has impressively claimed 14 wickets with an economy rate of 6.63, and Gerald Coetzee, who has added 12 wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>As both teams face crucial circumstances, this upcoming clash at Ekana Stadium promises high stakes and intense competition, with each side desperate to claim a victory and boost their prospects for the remainder of the season.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Birthday Bash&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"kiss\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/party.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"kiss\" />&nbsp;:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">ROHIT SHARMA&nbsp; ( TURNS 37 YEARS YOUNG !! )</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head In IPL:</strong><br />\n<strong>In the four games played between the two teams, LSG have managed to win thrice while MI has won only once.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (15)_1714473046.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones Alert <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/fire.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>2 - <span style=\"color:#000066\">KL Rahul</span> (48) is two hits away from completing 50 sixes for LSG in IPL.<br />\n2 - <span style=\"color:#000066\">Nicholas Pooran</span> (48) is two hits away from completing 50 sixes for LSG in IPL.<br />\n4 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya</span> (46) needs four wickets to complete 50 wickets for MI in IPL.<br />\n6 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Tim David</span> (44) needs six sixes to complete 50 maximums in IPL.<br />\n8 - <span style=\"color:#000066\">Krunal Pandya</span> (92) needs eight sixes to complete 100 sixes in T20s.<br />\n10 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma</span> (490) needs 10 fours to complete 500 fours for MI in IPL.<br />\n35 - <span style=\"color:#000066\">KL Rahul</span> (867) needs 35 runs to become the leading run-scorer against MI in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report:<br />\n<br />\nGraeme Swann and Aaron Finch: &quot;It&#39;s a used pitch as we identified by the footmarks. 66m square - shorter side, the pockets are about 71m, straight down the ground it is 76m. 163 was the score here last time and they defended it. That should give the bowlers a lot of confidence. There is a little bit of grass on the surface and as we come down the strip a little bit more, you see some bare patches. I expect it to be on the slower side. Expect the ball to spin and hold in the wicket a little bit more. There&#39;s a bit of a breeze tonight.

Both teams have secured five wins each, though Delhi has played two more games than Kolkata. The Knight Riders come into this match after enduring one of the most dramatic finishes in IPL history, having conceded a record chase of 262 to Punjab Kings on their home ground. Recent matches at Eden Gardens have consistently seen high scores, with two successful chases over 220 and a narrow miss, indicating a trend of high-scoring games this season. So far, scores over 200 have been recorded 29 times in 46 matches, with 18 resulting in wins.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite being strong on paper, KKR&#39;s bowling has faltered, contributing to two losses in their last three games. They aim to address these shortcomings as they seek to regain their winning form. Positioned second in the standings, Kolkata&#39;s openers, Phil Salt and Sunil Narine, have consistently given them strong starts.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi Capitals, meanwhile, enter this game following a close 10-run win against Mumbai Indians, where they posted a formidable 257. The team has relied heavily on the scoring prowess of Rishabh Pant, Tristan Stubbs, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, with Fraser impressing with his aggressive starts. Pant, Stubbs, and Axar Patel have been crucial in the middle and death overs, contributing significantly. Delhi hopes to extend their winning streak, backed by Kuldeep Yadav and Khaleel Ahmed, who have each taken 12 wickets, bolstering their bowling attack.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>As both teams prepare for this crucial encounter, the focus will be on adjusting strategies to exploit the high-scoring conditions at Eden Gardens, with KKR aiming to stabilize their campaign and Delhi looking to climb higher in the standings.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in IPL:</strong><br />\nIn the 32 games contested between the two teams, KKR have an upper-hand with 17 wins to DC&#39;s 15.<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (14)_1714393402.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Records Galore in IPL 2024:</strong><br />\n<strong>1 - First instance of four openers scoring 50 or more in an IPL game (KKR vs PBKS).<br />\n4 - Number of times the match aggregates have crossed 500 in T20s in 2024, most in a calendar year in T20s surpassing the record set in 2023 with 3<br />\n8 - Totals of 250 or more have been scored eight times in this IPL Season.<br />\n9 - Hundreds scored by opening batters in IPL 2024, the most in a season.Previously eight centuries were scored by openers in 2023 season.<br />\n42 - Number of sixes smashed in KKR vs PBKS game, the most in a single T20 match.<br />\n262 - Highest IPL total in a losing cause scored by RCB against SRH.<br />\n287 - Highest total in IPL in winning cause scored by SRH against RCB.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones Alert:</strong><br />\n<strong>2 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Venkatesh Iyer</span> (48) needs two sixes to complete 50 IPL Sixes.<br />\n3 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Axar Patel</span> (97) needs three fours to complete 100 fours in IPL.<br />\n6 - <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer</span> (2994) needs six runs to complete 3000 runs in IPL.<br />\n6 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Rinku Singh</span> (44) needs six sixes to complete 50 sixes&nbsp;<br />\n17 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Shai Hope</span> (2483) needs 17 runs to complete 3000 runs in T20s.<br />\n97 - <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Sunil Narine</span> (1403) needs 97 runs to complete 1500 runs in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\nT20s AT KOLKATA IN IPL 2024:&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST: 2<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;SECOND : 3<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 215</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#330000\"><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nDarren Ganga &amp; Simon Katich: &quot; 59 &amp; 71 meters are the square boundaries.

That has been the feature of this year&#39;s IPL, it has become a game of very small margins for the bowler. I personally enjoyed the wicket of Stubbs more.

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Gujarat Titans are set to host Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Match Number 45 of TATA IPL 2024 at the Narendra Modi Stadium. Both teams are struggling in the lower half of the points table, with the visitors currently at the bottom. Royal Challengers Bangalore come into this match with a bit of momentum, having secured a win against Sunrisers Hyderabad in their last outing, breaking a streak of six consecutive losses. They are keen to build on this recent success, especially with their bowling unit showing significant improvement.</p>\n\n<p>On the other side, the Gujarat Titans are looking to recover from a narrow defeat against Delhi Capitals, where they lost by just four runs while chasing a formidable target of 225. A major concern for the Titans has been the lackluster performance of their middle order, which has contributed the least runs in the league so far this season. The team urgently needs these key players to step up if they are to compete effectively and return to winning ways. As both teams face off, Gujarat aims to leverage home advantage to overcome their challenges, while Bangalore looks to continue their revival in form.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Head-To-Head In IPL:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (15)_1714293412.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Potential Contenders for T20 World Cup:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Since IPL 2023, Virat Kohli has been in exceptional form, amassing 1,098 runs in just 25 innings with an average of 52 and a strike rate of 142.78. His outstanding performance has earned him the Orange Cap in IPL 2024. Kohli&#39;s consistent run-scoring and extensive experience are crucial for India&#39;s prospects at the upcoming World Cup. Selectors are considering whether to utilize him as an opener or at the number three position, aiming to capitalize on his ability to anchor the innings. His role will be pivotal in providing stability and guiding the team through high-pressure situations, ensuring India can build substantial totals or chase down challenging targets.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Individual player stats (2)_1714294248.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones Alert:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>49- <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis</span> (9951) needs 49 runs to complete 10000 runs in T20s</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>3- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rashid Khan</span> (147) needs three wickets to complete 150 wickets in IPL</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>22- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rahul Tewatia</span> (978) needs 22 runs to complete 1000 runs in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>76- <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Virat Kohli</span> ( 12424) needs 76 runs to complete 12500 runs in T20s</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>T20 AT AHMEDABAD IN IPL 2024:&nbsp;</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>WON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST: 1</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>WON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />SECOND : 3</strong></li>\n\t<li><strong>AVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 154</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#330000\">PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</span><br />\n<span style=\"color:#330000\">Michael Clarke and Graeme Swann: &quot; It&#39;s a hot day, 62m and 64m are the square boundaries while down the ground is at 72m.

Skipper Sanju Samson led from the front after the openers departed in quick succession with a sensational unbeaten century, anchoring the chase with crucial partnerships alongside Riyan Parag and Dhruv Jurel. Samson&#39;s masterclass ensured Rajasthan chased down the target with an over to spare, finishing at 199/3.

We didn&rsquo;t get an ideal start but with the partnership between myself and Hooda, we came back. In these sorts of games, the set batter had to score close to a hundred after getting to a half-century. I think we were 150 after about 15 overs, should have capitalized on it. I think it is clear that the team with more sixes ends up winning. We do try to hit our sixes but today we had to change our approach after those two early wickets. If Hooda pushed on and scored 20 more, and I got 20 more then we&rsquo;d finish around 220. That would have been the difference, that&rsquo;s the 20 runs we left behind.

Delhi is coming into this match following a close victory over Gujarat Titans, where they narrowly defended a total of 224, thanks to standout performances from Axar Patel and Rishabh Pant, and Mukesh Kumar&#39;s effective death bowling. With Jake Fraser-McGurk providing solid starts and Tristan Stubbs finishing strong, Delhi aims to maintain their winning momentum.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, Mumbai Indians are looking to recover from a heavy defeat against Rajasthan Royals, where their bowling vulnerabilities were exposed, especially as Jasprit Bumrah struggled against Yashasvi Jaiswal&#39;s batting onslaught. The recent inclusion of Nuwan Thushara has yet to yield significant results, but he is expected to play a crucial role alongside Bumrah in the death overs. Mumbai, having already secured a win against Delhi earlier this season, is eager to replicate that success and get back on the winning track.

What used to take a couple of overs to change is now happening in just a few balls. Given the intense pressure on the bowlers in such games, we&#39;ve backed ourselves to adapt.Reflecting on our performance, there were moments where we could have been more aggressive, particularly during the middle overs. With a left-arm spinner like Axar Patel bowling, our left-handed batters could have taken more chances, which unfortunately we missed out on due to a lack of game awareness.Jake Fraser-McGurk&#39;s batting was truly impressive. He displayed maturity by selecting the right balls to attack, taking calculated risks, and utilizing the field effectively. It&#39;s a testament to the fearlessness of youth.As for the decision to bowl first, I wouldn&#39;t change it.&quot;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh pant,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We were pretty satisfied with our score, crossing the 250-mark. However, the impact player rule adds a new layer of complexity to the game with each passing day. As for keeping up to the stumps, it&#39;s definitely something I can do. Yet, it requires coordination with the bowlers, especially when they&#39;re delivering full and wide deliveries. It&#39;s a strategy to keep the batters in check within their crease.Today, it worked well, particularly against a batter like David who tends to walk down the pitch. Fraser-McGurk has been outstanding since day one, displaying remarkable growth in each match. It&#39;s precisely the kind of progress you hope to see in a young player.Regarding our playoff chances, they&#39;re gradually improving, but we&#39;re adopting a game-by-game approach, focusing on the present without getting ahead of ourselves.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nJake Fraser - McGurk </strong></span><strong>is the Player of the Match&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /><br />\n<br />\nJake Fraser - McGurk:&quot;</strong></span><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">It was nerve-wracking out there.

Being in the thick of the action, you truly realize the level of competition in the IPL compared to other leagues, and it&#39;s an incredible experience to be part of it.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Coming off a narrow victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore, KKR is well-positioned in second place in the points table and aims to maintain their winning momentum. On the other hand, Punjab Kings are struggling this season, having suffered back-to-back losses and languishing in ninth place on the leaderboard. With their top order failing to make significant scores, Punjab will be eager for a turnaround in fortunes and is desperate for a win to improve their standing.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Punjab&#39;s matches have predominantly been close encounters, with seven out of their eight games decided in the dramatic final overs. As the teams prepare to face off, the key question remains: Will KKR continue to dominate, or will Punjab manage to find the much-needed luck to swing the game in their favor?

Since the start of IPL 2023, Rinku has amassed 1193 in just 38 innings averaging over 62 while striking at 162.09.

We&#39;re back at Hyderabad&#39;s pitch number 2, where a massive 277 was scored against Mumbai Indians. The ground dimensions: 63m on the right, 66m on the left, and 76m straight down. Can we expect 300 tonight?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Katich: &quot; Absolutely! Though slightly rough, SRH is in top form, and this pitch looks perfect for batting. Expect fireworks like the 38 Sixes in the MI match. RCB showed promise against KKR, with Jacks and Patidar impressing. Can their bowlers contain SRH&#39;s powerhouse lineup?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Badree: &quot;Last time these teams clashed, they set a record with 549 runs.

The Titans come on the back of a convincing victory at Mullanpur and will look to continue their winning run, whereas the home team Delhi will look to bounce back after their loss against Hyderabad at this venue, and can find solace from just a week back where they had played the Titans and bundled them out for just 89 (the lowest total of the season), to ensure a convincing victory. <strong>Another crucial battle on the cards tonight is between the spinners of the two sides, as the Titans have picked up the most wickets by spinners this season (19), followed by the Capitals (18).</strong> It will be crucial 2 points on the grab for Gujarat and Delhi, who are at the 6th and 8th place respectively. Which side&#39;s spinners will ride the momentum and help their team move up the table tonight <img alt=\"yes\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/thinking.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"yes\" />?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD-TO-HEAD IN IPL:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The teams have won two each in the 4 times they have faced each other, with the Capitals getting on top in their most recent encounter this year. However, when they clashed in the Arun Jaitley stadium last year, it was the Titans who had emerged on top. Will it be a repeat of the same this year or can the Capitals do the double against the Titans?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (12)_1713960821.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stats at Arun Jaitley Stadium:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The national capital hosted it&#39;s first game of this IPL in the Capital&#39;s previous game of the season against Sunrisers, and the Orange Army had posted 266 on board batting first and there were a whopping<span style=\"color:#16a085\"> <strong>465 runs</strong></span> scored in the game. Although last season&#39;s average score suggests only <span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>176</strong></span>, there has been a recent trend of big scores at the venue in the WPL, where there were<strong> <span style=\"color:#16a085\">7 totals of 180+</span></strong> in the venue compared to just 2 at Bengaluru this year, and also a high avg score of 332 in the ODI WC held in India last year. The teams batting first had won <span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>3/5</strong></span> matches in the ODI WC, <span style=\"color:#16a085\"><strong>7/11</strong></span> matches in the WPL and also the last game held in this year&#39;s IPL at the venue.

After opting to field in his 100th IPL game, Shubman Gill and the Gujarat Titans got off to a great start in the Powerplay courtesy of Sandeep Warrier who picked up three wickets, after which Axar Patel and Rishabh Pant got together and stitched up a 113-run partnership with both of them scoring <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/50.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&#39;s, to swing the momentum back in DC&#39;s favour. <strong>One of the highlights of the innings was Axar Patel&#39;s promotion in the batting order to Number 3, as he was crucial in taking down the Titan&#39;s Afghan spin duo (26 runs off 17 balls against Rashid Khan and 20 runs off 8 balls against Noor Ahmad).</strong> A late flourish from Pant and Stubbs ensured Delhi ended up with 224 on board, of which <strong>97 were scored in the last 5!</strong></p>\n\n<p>Wriddhiman Saha and Sai Sudharsan got the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> off to a flyer in the chase, scoring their <strong>highest Powerplay score of the season</strong>.

Disappointing to lose in the end, but great character shown by everyone. When you&#39;re chasing 224, there&#39;s no point in talking about plans, just go out and score runs. At one stage, we thought we would be able to restrict them to 200-210, but we gave away some extra runs in the last 2-3 overs. Execution becomes very important, if there&#39;s a set batter or a finisher, you&#39;ll have to execute well. It&#39;s okay if there&#39;s something in the wicket, but on pitches like this, you&#39;ll have to make sure that you execute all your plans perfectly, be it the yorkers or the variations.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh Pant is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh Pant:</strong></span> &quot;I think it is about instincts as a captain, it will come off sometimes and happy it worked today. Surely at 43/3, we wanted to just keep going and target their main spinners. If we get something we will take it on and keep rotating the strike. Every day that I&#39;m in the middle, I feel better. Every hour on the field matters, and I love being on the field. I think the first six in the match gives me confidence in a game. The more time I spend in the centre, the better I feel.&quot;</p>\n",

This match comes right after both teams faced each other, with Lucknow Super Giants taking the victory in their last encounter.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chennai Super Kings comes into this game following their third away loss of the season against Lucknow. With eight points from seven games, they are currently fourth in the standings, just above Lucknow.

Yash Thakur leads their bowling attack with eight wickets, with substantial contributions from the rest of the bowling lineup. Riding on their recent success, Lucknow is looking to maintain their momentum and climb further up the leaderboard.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in IPL:</strong><br />\nIn the four games played between the two, Lucknow has won two games while Chennai has won one game.

To the right, the distance measures about 66 meters, and to the left, it&#39;s just a meter more. The ground extends to 78 meters directly ahead. This pitch seems to present different conditions on each half. Near us, there are patches of grass, while the opposite end boasts a uniform grass cover. It&#39;s not likely to be a high-scoring pitch of 200 runs. Expect some early dew today, similar to the conditions in the KKR match.

There will be some dew later on, but you never know how the wicket will surprise you. You just need to go out there and express yourself. Just attack when the ball is in the arc. Hoping to set the foundation early on. Daryl comes in for Rachin. Pretty good to have three home games.

Marcus Stoinis emerged as the hero of the night, delivering a monumental innings that defied expectations. LSG won the toss and elected to field here at Chepauk considering the dew factor. CSK had a mixed start with Ajinkya Rahane falling early. Ruturaj Gaikwad, alongside Daryl Mitchell, steadied the innings. Despite Mitchell&#39;s early departure, Gaikwad&#39;s impressive knock of 108 not out and Shivam Dube&#39;s explosive 66 off 27 balls propelled CSK to 210. In the second innings, despite a shaky start with early losses, including Quinton de Kock and KL Rahul, LSG found themselves under pressure with a hefty target of 211. The game&#39;s pace changed dramatically as Stoinis, paired first with Nicholas Pooran and then Deepak Hooda, shifted gears dramatically. Stoinis not only scored a staggering 124 from 63 deliveries, but his innings also included a high-octane final over where he secured the win with three balls to spare.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image (20)_1713897445.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, CSK Captain: &quot;Tough to accept, but good game of cricket. LSG played well. We had the game in control till 14 overs, but Stoinis played a great innings. Dew played a part and it took our spinners out of the game. Otherwise, we&nbsp;could have controlled the game better and taken it deeper. But these are parts of the game. Jaddu is batting at number 4 since we lost the second wicket within the powerplay. I thought our target wasn&rsquo;t enough.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">KL Rahul, LSG Captain: &quot;Very special. It was very special to pull it off from where we were before. Different conditions here. I think they started off really well and put us under pressure. 170-180 would&rsquo;ve been a great total here but they batted really well. Full credit to Stoinis. It was not just power hitting, it was very clever batting. You need to go harder in the powerplay and the impact player rule also gives you a bit more depth. There&rsquo;s no set plan, apart from the openers, everyone else is ready to go out whenever we feel it&#39;s right.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Marcus Stoinis is the Player of the Match<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/crown.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Marcus Stoinis:&nbsp;&quot;There were some bowlers we wanted to target and some bowlers we wanted to be more cautious against. There was a phase where I wasn&rsquo;t able to hit the boundaries so it was great Pooran could come in and take the pressure off. Lots of ebbs and flows, just tried to keep it in control. I do think T20 cricket is changing, the impact player role and how teams are taking on the bowlers. On the playing front, I&rsquo;d like to play and contribute.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

This encounter marks their second clash of the season, with the Royals having triumphed in their previous meeting.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Rajasthan Royals are riding high this season, boasting six wins from their seven games, with their only defeat coming against Gujarat Titans while defending a score over 190. Riyan Parag has emerged as a standout performer, amassing 318 runs across seven games. Sanju Samson and Jos Buttler have also made significant contributions, scoring 276 and 250 runs respectively, with Buttler&#39;s average of 62.50 including two centuries. Yuzvendra Chahal leads their bowling attack with 12 wickets, supported by Avesh Khan and Trent Boult who have each taken seven wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai Indians have experienced a mixed tournament, securing three wins against four losses and currently sit seventh on the points table with six points. Rohit Sharma has been a key player in their batting lineup, accumulating 297 runs, while Tilak Varma and Ishan Kishan have also contributed 208 and 192 runs respectively. The team&#39;s bowling, however, has been a concern, with only Jasprit Bumrah and Gerald Coetzee performing consistently. Mumbai is considering strategic changes, potentially bringing in Nuwan Thushara to replace either Mohammad Nabi or Romario Shepherd, aiming to revitalize their campaign.

In their 13 previous encounters, Chahal has dismissed Pandya four times, conceding 63 runs off 69 deliveries. Another intriguing battle to watch is between Jasprit Bumrah and Jos Buttler. Bumrah has dismissed Buttler twice across 65 balls, with Buttler managing to score 62 runs in their six innings of face-offs.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for_1713791299.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>PITCH REPORT | Natalie Germanos &amp; Brian Lara&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Natalie: &quot;The IPL matches at this ground have been quite intriguing this season. Out of the four games played here, teams batting first have won twice, while teams fielding first have also emerged victorious twice. Spinners haven&#39;t dominated over seamers as expected, and the team scores have generally ranged between 180 to 190. Tonight, we find ourselves in the middle once again, with square boundaries measuring 67 meters on either side and a straight hit distance of 76 meters.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lara: &quot;This pitch is truly a sight to behold. It&#39;s dry, hard, and impeccably even. Addressing the question of why we haven&#39;t seen scores over 200, I believe it comes down to the lack of moisture, which typically provides bounce. Without that extra bounce, players may feel cautious about playing cross-batted shots against bowlers targeting the stumps directly. While the pitch remains conducive to batting and we may still witness scores close to 200, surpassing that milestone would likely require a bit more bounce. Nonetheless, it&#39;s a beautiful pitch to bat on, and with two formidable batting teams like the Mumbai Indians and the Rajasthan Royals, we&#39;re in for an exciting contest.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (1)_1713795955.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE :&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BAT FIRST&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image (23)_1713796090.png\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;<strong>Hardik Pandya&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />Skipper : &quot;We are going to bat first. It just looks like a good wicket if it slows up. We didn&#39;t see much dew in a couple of days of practice, so just thought that batting first would be ideal. It&#39;s a surreal feeling to play my 100th game for the franchise.I started my journey here, and I&#39;m very grateful for everything I&#39;ve experienced over the years. It still surprises me sometimes, the way things have unfolded for me. I think we&#39;ve taken a lot of positives from all four games. While one game didn&#39;t go our way, we&#39;ve also learned from the wins, aiming to rectify any mistakes. We&#39;re focused on improving with each game and looking forward to what&#39;s ahead.We have made three changes, N. Tushara, N. Wadhera, and P. Chawla come in for A. Madhwal, R. Shepherd, and S.

This emphatic win solidified their position at the top of the table, leaving Mumbai with plenty to ponder.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai&#39;s batting woes started early, their top order crumbling like a sandcastle.

Jos Buttler (35 off 25) provided a quickfire start, but the evening belonged to the young gun, Yashasvi Jaiswal. Picking up from where he left off after a rain break, Jaiswal treated the Mumbai attack with disdain. His unbeaten 104 off a mere 60 deliveries &ndash; his second century against Mumbai and his first of the season &ndash; sealed the win in style.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai&#39;s bowling attack, usually their strength, faltered under pressure. Jasprit Bumrah (0 wickets, 37 runs) and debutant Nuwan Thushara (0 wickets, 28 runs) were expensive, while dropped catches added to their misery. However, the story of the night belonged to Rajasthan&#39;s Sandeep Sharma, who ripped through the Mumbai batting order with a career-best spell of 5/18.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image_1713811994.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;I think we put ourselves in trouble early on.

We had to keep it within the stumps. It was not our best day on the field.Everyone&#39;s professional. They know their roles. Progression is important.

We started off really well with the ball in the powerplay. In the end, both the left-handers played unbelievably well. Some quality spin from R. Ashwin and Y. Chahal. The way they went after them was really great. B. Kumar, S. Sharma, and A. Khan came back well, and that won the game.The wicket looked dry, but Jaipur is still colder. When the lights come on, it looks like a better wicket to bat on. It came true today.The way J. Buttler and Y. Jaiswal batted for a couple of overs after rain, we knew that we had to just reset and go back to our momentum. People are professional enough to understand what they need to do when they get a break, so I am really happy with the approach.Y. Jaiswal always gets confidence. We knew it&#39;s just a matter of one game. The way he batted in the powerplay, he was calm and composed, knowing that things are in control. We knew in the dugout that he is playing some cricketing shots and he will be fine today. I am really happy for him.We are going to Lucknow.

I got fit just two days ago, so this is my first game after recovery. Feeling really good. The pitch was on the slower and lower side, so my plan was to keep bowling those variations, including cutters. It worked out really nicely tonight.If you&#39;re bowling in the end, you have to have a big heart. As we&#39;ve seen in this IPL, bowlers are under pressure and batsmen are going big. So it&#39;s important to keep believing in yourself, and execute your variations and plans. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do, and I&#39;m enjoying myself. As you know, two years ago, I went unsold and came in as a replacement. So, any game I get to play, I consider it a bonus and just enjoy myself.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Hovering near the bottom, Punjab is desperate to climb up the ranks. They&#39;ve been hit hard by injuries, notably missing Shikhar Dhawan. Yet, they&#39;ve seen a glimmer of hope in the form of Shashank Singh and Ashutosh Sharma, whose heroics have snatched victory from the jaws of defeat earlier this season against Gujarat. Will they deliver another spectacular performance?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans, just a spot above Punjab, haven&#39;t fared much better. Despite Shubman Gill&rsquo;s steady contributions, the team&#39;s overall inconsistency is glaring. However, their bowlers, led by the adept Rashid Khan, have kept them in games, even though a recent blowout loss to Delhi Capitals rattled them.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Historically, games between these two have favored the chasers, often ending in dramatic last-over finishes. Punjab will surely look to repeat their earlier thrilling win against Gujarat in hopes of reviving their campaign.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Key players to watch include Punjab&rsquo;s middle-order bats Shashank and Ashutosh, and their pacer Arshdeep Singh, who needs to snag more wickets. For Gujarat, the spotlight is on Gill for runs and Rashid Khan for tight overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Expect a run fest at this high-scoring venue as both teams battle it out this Sunday, each eager to assert dominance and turn their fortunes around in the league.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>THE MATCHUP IS EVEN BETWEEN THESE TWO FRANCHISES.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (10)_1713640183.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>VENUE STATS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;HAVE WON ONLY ONE GAME IN THEIR HOME GROUND.</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2024-04-21T003925_1713640203.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>MILESTONE ALERT</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/party-popper.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;:</p>\n\n<p><strong>100 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Harshal Patel</span> is all set to play his 100th IPL game&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>67 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Liam Livingstone</span> (933) needs 67 runs to reach 1000 runs in IPL.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>5 -<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"> David Miller</span> (195) needs five fours to reach 200 fours in IPL</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>62 - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rahul Tewatia</span> (938) needs 62 runs to reach 1000 runs in IPL</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>5- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Vijay Shankar</span> (45) needs five sixes to complete 50 IPL Sixes</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>4- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rashid Khan</span> (146) is four wickets away from reaching 150 IPL Wickets.</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>BATTLES TO WATCH OUT FOR:</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for_1713704857.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT :<br />\n<br />\nBadree: &quot;Here we are at the new PCA Stadium in Mullanpur for PBKS vs GT.

MI&#39;s Sharma and Yadav showed how to build innings and accelerate later, reaching 192, the par score. Despite a 174 average first innings, today&#39;s surface looks better.

Looking to put some good runs on the board. Our record here has not been the best. This is the third time we are using this pitch. We will try to put pressure on the Gujarat Titans&#39; bowling attack. That&#39;s the nature of IPL. It&#39;s such a big tournament; on a given day, anyone can win against any side. Absolutely. We know if we turn up with the right plans and attitude, we can win. It&#39;s about overseas players taking more responsibility and helping the Indian players. Shikhar Dhawan is still not playing.

Chasing a below-par total of 143 runs, GT emerged triumphant by 3 wickets with 5 balls to spare, thanks to a late onslaught by the swashbuckling Rahul Tewatia. Opting to bat first, Punjab Kings got off to a promising start with openers Prabhsimran Singh and Sam Curran stitching together a 52-run partnership. However, their batting woes resurfaced as wickets fell in quick succession. The middle order failed to capitalize, leaving the team reeling at 99/7 after 16 overs. A late cameo from Harpreet Brar (29 runs off 12 balls) provided a much-needed boost, taking Punjab past the 140-run mark. The innings eventually folded for a meager 142 runs, with Sai Kishore wreaking havoc for Gujarat Titans, claiming a four-wicket haul. Mohit Sharma and Noor Ahmad chipped in with two wickets each, while Rashid Khan picked up one. Gujarat&#39;s chase began on a shaky note as they lost their prolific wicket-keeper batsman Wriddhiman Saha early on. However, the young guns Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan displayed maturity, consolidating the innings with a 40-run partnership. Just as GT seemed to be in control, Liam Livingstone rattled their batting order, dismissing the dangerous David Miller and the in-form Gill. With the score reading 89/4 and victory slipping away, Rahul Tewatia rose to the occasion. He played a blistering knock of 36 runs off just 18 balls, peppering the boundaries with his trademark sixes. His aggressive batting reignited Gujarat&#39;s hopes and put the pressure back on Punjab. Despite losing a couple of late wickets, GT secured a thrilling victory with 5 balls remaining, thanks to Tewatia&#39;s heroics.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image_1713723554.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sam Curran&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;I believe we fell short by about 10-15 runs. The bowlers put in a remarkable effort, displaying exceptional commitment and determination, but it wasn&#39;t quite sufficient.&nbsp;The Afghanistan spinners are world-class bowlers and Sai Kishore bowled really well, credit to them.&nbsp;Despite this being the third match on this pitch, achieving anything above 160 would have been considered par. Prabhsimran&#39;s strong performance in the powerplay was noteworthy, but unfortunately, we lost momentum with a cluster of wickets thereafter. Moving forward, we understand the importance of winning every upcoming game.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>We would have preferred to close out the match a bit earlier, but securing those two points is always satisfying.

When I&#39;m batting, my focus is solely on playing my natural game without letting the captaincy responsibilities distract me. Regarding the incident with Livingstone, the decision I made to get out would have been the same whether I was captaining or not, and it wasn&#39;t influenced by any previous exchange.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Sai Kishore, Player of the Match <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />:</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Just trying to give my 120% for the team, playing after 20-25 days, so just wanted to go there, enjoy myself and give my everything.&nbsp;Under Ashish Nehra&#39;s guidance, we&#39;ve cultivated an environment where we can play fearlessly, irrespective of the outcome. He encouraged me to enjoy the game and express myself freely, which boosted my confidence. I sensed the conditions well and relied on change of pace, which proved effective. It was a collective effort from everyone, with Rahul delivering another stellar performance and Rashid and Noor bowling superbly. It feels great to contribute to such a cohesive team effort.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

Their batting has been a force to be reckoned with, with Sunil Narine&#39;s century still fresh in everyone&#39;s minds. Youngsters like Raghuvanshi are providing valuable support, while the experienced Andre Russell remains a constant threat. Bowling, however, has shown some inconsistency, with Mitchell Starc needing to tighten his grip in the death overs.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For RCB, it&#39;s a different story. They&#39;re languishing at the bottom after a string of demoralizing losses. Their bowling attack has been leaky, and their batting is heavily reliant on the brilliance of Virat Kohli and veteran Dinesh Karthik. Interestingly, RCB will be sporting their green jerseys, usually reserved for afternoon home games, hoping for a change in fortune.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The recent head-to-head record heavily favours KKR, who thrashed RCB by 7 wickets in their last encounter.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nHEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR HAS THE EDGE AGAINST RCB.

Let&#39;s delve into recent history. Last time at Eden Gardens, Kolkata Knight Riders amassed 223, with Sunil Narine even reaching a century. Despite that, Rajasthan Royals successfully chased down the target. So, you&#39;d expect a plethora of runs on this pitch. However, being an afternoon game alters the dynamics entirely. Let me quickly remind you of the boundaries: one short boundary to my right, roughly 61 meters, and to the left, 66 meters.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Swann: &quot;Oh, it&#39;s incredibly hot out here today, a scorching <span style=\"color:#d35400\">43 degrees</span> in the middle. This pitch is going to feel the brunt of it. It&#39;s parched, very dry indeed. This strip has been used before, and there&#39;s one fascinating aspect I&#39;d like to point out. Most of the pitch is fairly even, but there&#39;s this distinct band here in the good length area. It&#39;s a big circle of dryness, forming a slight arc across the wicket. The grass has been trimmed more in this section, making it a tad plainer than the rest. Whether this translates to drier conditions or more sun exposure remains to be seen. Spinners might find this intriguing as it&#39;s about a spinner&#39;s length. Bowling from that end could yield some movement, but overall, this pitch looks fantastic, and I anticipate a run-fest.&quot;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Manjrekar: &quot;The burning question for an afternoon clash: win the toss, what&#39;s your call?&quot;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Swann: &quot;I&#39;d opt to bat first. It might not be the popular choice as many prefer to chase, but considering the intense heat, it could prove to be a significant advantage. So, my vote goes to batting first.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (3)_1713692630.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE :&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#27ae60\">WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD FIRST&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image (2)_1713694551.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Faf du Plessis <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;We&#39;ve decided to chase. Eden Gardens has a history of favoring the chasing side, and we&#39;ll stick to that strategy today. We observed the conditions yesterday, and it did get cooler after a while, so we&#39;ll look to adapt accordingly. T20 cricket has evolved, and even conceding runs in the powerplay doesn&#39;t necessarily mean poor bowling. The key is to take wickets consistently, even if the opposition is scoring, and capitalize on the latter part of their innings.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Last time around, we played an afternoon game here, so we&#39;ve got a good sense of how the pitch behaves.

Our batsmen are in fine touch, so we&#39;ll aim to keep it simple and stick to the basics. No changes in our lineup. It&#39;s crucial to adapt quickly to the conditions, execute our plans, and play each ball on its merit.

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) engaged in a high-octane battle, culminating in a heart-stopping finish that saw KKR edge out by the slimmest of margins, a solitary run. The day commenced with KKR taking the crease first after RCB opted to field. The innings started on a shaky note with Sunil Narine returning to the pavilion early, managing only 10 runs off 15 balls. Despite Sunil Narine&#39;s early dismissal, Phil Salt set the stage ablaze.&nbsp;Displaying a masterclass in aggressive batting, Salt blazed through RCB&#39;s bowling lineup, hammering 48 runs from just 14 balls, electrifying the crowd with his audacious strokes. Though Angkrish Raghuvanshi and Venkatesh Iyer couldn&rsquo;t make significant contributions, scoring 3 and 16 runs respectively, it was Shreyas Iyer who anchored the innings. Displaying maturity and finesse, Shreyas crafted a well-composed 50 off 36 balls. The innings was further bolstered by cameos from Rinku Singh, who added a quickfire 24, and the duo of Andre Russell and Ramandeep Singh, who remained not out, contributing 27 and 24 runs respectively to set a formidable target of 222/6 for RCB. As RCB began their chase, Virat Kohli launched an onslaught, albeit briefly, smashing 18 runs off just 7 balls before his dismissal. Faf du Plessis, usually reliable, faltered and was dismissed for 7, leaving RCB in a precarious position. However, the tide turned with Will Jacks and Rajat Patidar at the crease. The pair orchestrated a stunning display of batting, both reaching their fifties and adding over 100 runs together, momentarily putting RCB in a dominant position. But the game was far from over. Andre Russell, known for his knack for crucial breakthroughs, was introduced into the attack and delivered spectacularly by removing both set batters in a single over. This pivotal moment swung the momentum back in favour of KKR as RCB began losing wickets at regular intervals. Despite a valiant 25 from Dinesh Karthik, RCB found themselves needing 21 runs from the final over with Karn Sharma on strike. In an over that defined the term &#39;cliffhanger,&#39; Sharma hammered Mitchell Starc for three sixes in four balls, dramatically reducing the equation to 3 runs needed from the final two deliveries. The penultimate ball saw Starc taking a stunning low catch off his own bowling to dismiss Sharma. With one ball left and the scores almost level, Lockie Ferguson came to the crease, managed to score only one run, and was run out while attempting the second run that would have tied the game. This last-ball thriller, where the match hung in balance till the final moment, was a showcase of cricket at its most exhilarating. The pendulum of fortune swung wildly before resting in KKR&#39;s favour, concluding a match that was nothing less than a saga of dramatic twists, individual brilliance, and nerve-wracking excitement.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image_1713712504.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Faf du Plessis <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>It was crazy, rules are rules. Virat and I thought that the ball was higher than the waist (on Kohli&#39;s dismissal). I guess they measured from the popping crease. One team thinks it&#39;s high, the other doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s how the game goes at times. Then the partnership, it was magnificent (on the Jacks-Patidar partnership), but when you don&#39;t win too many games, some sort of panic sets in and the Narine over was game-changing. You don&#39;t feel that you have time to settle down and bat (on the evolution of the IPL this season). The game doesn&#39;t allow it to do that; obviously, you have an extra batter, but in chases like these, you have to keep going. The match-up against Narine, I thought that was the game-changing over. The small things, I am actually proud of the boys tonight, the way we bowled and fielded. We did give away a couple of big overs towards the end, but I thought we kept them down to a par score. We thought we&#39;ll go hard in the batting powerplay, find those boundaries at the start of the innings. We were desperate, 10/10 from an effort perspective, the way we put up the effort on the ground, the faces told the story. We&#39;ve got an unbelievable fanbase, we want to make them happy, we want them to have a smile on their face. We&#39;ll have to continue putting in our efforts and try to change things around.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;It takes a lot off your body and drains you out completely because you go through so many emotions. It&rsquo;s tough to stay calm but I&rsquo;m elated. We got two points on the board and that&rsquo;s all that matters. It&rsquo;s extremely tough when the pressure is on; I feel that every individual should put their hands up and take the responsibility. Russell did that by picking up two wickets and completely changed the game in our favor; that kind of attitude is needed in the team. It&rsquo;s a funny game, when you need 18 runs off 6 balls, the pressure is on the bowler. One six here and there, it completely changes the momentum. It is important that we maintain our calmness and stay in the present and make the batter hit where you want them to hit. We need to stick to our routines and processes and see to it that we execute the things we want. It was a pivotal knock; I wanted to stay till the end and steady the ship. We were losing wickets and I wanted to stay till the end and see it off. We got some important boundaries towards the end and I was very happy about that.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nAndre Russell, Player of the match&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />:</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;Thanks to the almighty. I always back my bowling as I said earlier. Getting the ball at a crucial time, I knew that I had to come good and thankfully it happened today. Happy for the two points. When I was batting earlier, change of pace was difficult to hit. As a bowler that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do. The slower balls were gripping and holding. Was happy to get the two set batters out and I think that&rsquo;s what changed the game. Those two wickets from Narine were also very important and that&rsquo;s what started the slide for RCB. When I look at the bowling equation, I had two left and I conditioned myself to bowl that (19th) over. Tried to give Starc as many runs as I could. DK wasn&rsquo;t getting off strike so I looked at bowling 6 deliveries to him and mix it up, thankfully it worked.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

However, maintaining this momentum won&#39;t be a cakewalk, as their next challenge comes against the rampaging <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />.&nbsp;SRH, fresh off setting a new IPL record for the highest total, are redefining T20 batting with their aggressive approach. Their bowling, however, has been a cause for concern. While Pat Cummins and T Natarajan have impressed so far, the rest of the attack has leaked runs. SRH will need to tighten things up if they want to continue their winning ways.&nbsp;For DC, bowling has been their trump card in recent wins. The Indian pace trio of Ishant Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed, and Mukesh Kumar have been firing on all cylinders. Spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel add further depth to a well-balanced attack.&nbsp;The arrival of Jake Fraser-McGurk has bolstered the DC batting line-up. He and the experienced duo of Rishabh Pant and Prithvi Shaw provide a solid foundation. However, a question mark hangs over David Warner&#39;s availability, which could be a concern for the Capitals.&nbsp;This match promises to be a thrilling battle between a resurgent DC bowling attack and a free-scoring SRH batting line-up. Can the Capitals contain the orange brigade&#39;s batting blitz? Or will SRH continue their record-breaking run?

SRH, after being put to bat first, unleashed carnage from the get-go. The opening duo of Travis Head (89 off 32 balls) and Abhishek Sharma (46 off 12 balls) tore into the DC bowling, putting on a record-breaking 131-run partnership in just 38 balls! The powerplay was a nightmare for the Capitals as SRH amassed a staggering 125 runs. The onslaught continued with valuable contributions from Nitish Kumar Reddy (37 off 27 balls), Shahbaz Ahmed (59 off 29 balls), and Abdul Samad (13 off 8 balls). SRH finished their innings at a mammoth 266/7, the highest total in IPL history for the third time this season!&nbsp;Only the spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav (4-55) and Axar Patel (1-29) offered some resistance for DC. The pacers were taken to the cleaners, with Mukesh Kumar picking up a solitary wicket but conceding a lot of runs.&nbsp;Chasing a near-impossible target of 267, DC started brightly. Impact player Prithvi Shaw smashed four boundaries in the opening over but was dismissed cheaply by Washington Sundar. David Warner also departed early. However, Jake Fraser-McGurk (65 off 18 balls) and Abhishek Porel (42 off 22 balls) provided a glimmer of hope with their aggressive knocks. But the dismissal of Porel triggered a collapse, and DC were eventually bowled out for 199 in 19.1 overs.T Natarajan (4-19) was the wrecker-in-chief for SRH, picking up four crucial wickets. Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mayank Markande, Washington Sundar, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar chipped in with wickets as well.&nbsp;This comprehensive 67-run victory propels SRH to the second position in the points table. For DC, it&#39;s a bitter pill to swallow as they lose their first game at home. The match highlighted the destructive power of the SRH batting line-up and the need for DC to strengthen their bowling attack, especially their pace department.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (1)_1713637970.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The decision to bowl first was mainly based on the expectation of dew, which didn&#39;t materialize. Even so, if we had limited them to 220-230, we would have had a chance. However, their strong powerplay performance, scoring 125 runs, put us on the back foot. The ball stopped more than anticipated in the second innings, making the chase challenging.

Keeping things simple and reacting to each delivery has been key for me. I&#39;m delighted to be maintaining my form. Abhishek Sharma has been fantastic in the powerplay; he&#39;s aggressive against spin and it&#39;s great to see him doing well. Our team has a lot of depth, and everyone can contribute with both bat and ball. It&#39;s a luxury to have so many options, and that&#39;s what allows us to post such high scores. Our bowlers did a fantastic job tonight, especially in the powerplay. Personally, it&#39;s been nice to be back at the top of the order and getting back into the rhythm of T20 cricket.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

This rollercoaster ride places them fifth on the points table with three wins and three losses. Nicholas Pooran and KL Rahul have been pivotal in the batting lineup, scoring 223 and 204 runs respectively. In the bowling arena, Yash Thakur leads with seven wickets, closely followed by Naveen-ul-Haq and Mayank Yadav, who have each taken six wickets. Lucknow Super Giants are eager to regain their momentum.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>On the other side, Chennai Super Kings are riding high after clinching their first away win of the season against their arch-rivals, Mumbai Indians. Positioned third with four wins from six games, Chennai is keen to continue their strong performance. Shivam Dube has been a standout, accumulating 242 runs at an average of over 60. Meanwhile, skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad continues his consistent performance with 224 runs. Their bowling strength is significantly enhanced by the formidable death-over pair of Mustafizur Rahman and the young Matheesha Pathirana, with the former claiming 10 wickets in five innings and the latter adding eight in just three appearances.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Head-Tot-Head in IPL:</strong><br />\n<strong>In the three games played between the two teams, both teams have managed to win once while the other one game has ended in no-result.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (8)_1713457060.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>IPL Stats at Ekana Stadium:</strong><br />\n<strong>In the 9 games played at the venue, pacers have picked up 71 wickets while the spin bowlers have managed to pick 52 wickets.

The pitch is made of red soil and appears drier than previous matches here. There are a couple of bare spots, but they shouldn&#39;t affect play significantly. I expect the pitch to hold a bit more due to its Wankhede-like appearance. Being inland, there may not be as much spin since the soil doesn&#39;t compact tightly. However, I anticipate it to play well overall. The new ball will be crucial, and finding wickets in the powerplay will be key on this surface. Bowlers may look to pitch it up more and seek movement off the fine green grass early on. Winning the toss and bowling first could be advantageous.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024_1713534484.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>MILESTONE ALERT&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/bomb.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>7- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Nicholas Pooran </span>(1493) needs seven runs to complete 1500 runs in IPL<br />\n10- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Krunal Pandya </span>(140) needs 10 fours to complete 150 fours in IPL<br />\n5 - <span style=\"color:#e67e22\">MS Dhoni </span>(245) needs five sixes to complete 250 sixes in IPL<br />\n1- <span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Moeen Ali</span> (99) needs one catch to complete 100 T20 Catches</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/LSGvcsk_1713535635.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTOSS:&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL RAHUL&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;SKIPPER: &quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first. The wicket looks good, and dew hasn&#39;t been a big factor, so hopefully, it stays that way for the entire game. We prefer knowing what we&#39;re chasing. There weren&#39;t any major blunders in our previous games, despite the big defeat against KKR. We&#39;re still pretty relaxed. I believe in maintaining a calm demeanour as a leader, as panicking can spread. Our support staff is excellent, and we&#39;re trying to keep things as relaxed as possible. The pitches have been relaid here, so each match can bring something different. We have one change: Joseph is out, and Matt Henry comes in.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>RUTURAJ GAIKWAD&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;SKIPPER: &quot;We would have bowled first. Batted well in the last game against MI, and defending that total was a big confidence boost for us. We don&#39;t want to get complacent and aim to maintain consistency. Personally, I&#39;ve had a bit of luck with my batting, despite some unlucky dismissals in the first two matches. It feels good to be back and everyone is confident. Two changes: Mo comes in for Mitchell, and Deepak comes in for Shardul.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

KL Rahul&#39;s astute decision to bowl first proved to be advantageous. CSK, with the help of a valiant 57* from Ravindra Jadeja and contributions from Ajinkya Rahane (36) and MS Dhoni (28* off 9), could manage a fighting total of 176/6. Krunal Pandya and Marcus Stoinis were the bowling stars for LSG, keeping the CSK batsmen in check.&nbsp;In response,&nbsp;Openers KL Rahul (82 off 53) and Quinton de Kock (54 off 43) stitched together a magnificent 134-run partnership to lay the foundation for victory. Even after de Kock&#39;s dismissal, Rahul continued his aggressive knock, but a sensational one-handed catch by Jadeja brought his innings to an end. Nicholas Pooran and Marcus Stoinis ensured a comfortable finish, securing the win for LSG with 1 over to spare.&nbsp;CSK&#39;s bowlers struggled to contain the LSG batsmen. Matheesha Pathirana (1/29 in 4 overs) offered some resistance.&nbsp;This win propels LSG to 8 points on the table, joining the likes of KKR, CSK, and SRH. Both CSK and LSG find themselves in the top five, with the reverse fixture scheduled for Tuesday in Chennai. This promises to be another exciting encounter as both teams look to solidify their position in the IPL 2024 standings!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (27)_1713552063.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;captain: &quot;We finished well with the bat, considering the situation we were in. However, after the powerplay, we couldn&#39;t capitalize on the start and kept losing wickets at regular intervals. I believe we were 10-15 runs short of what we could have achieved. With the impact sub rule, you need extra runs. Pitches like these start off sluggish but improve with dew. 190 would have been a good score. One area we need to improve is taking wickets in the power play to put pressure on the opposition. It&#39;s good to play them again in the next game at Chepauk. We&#39;ll do our homework for the three upcoming home games.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;captain and player of the match:&quot;Feels good at the end of the day. When you win, most decisions feel right. We were committed to our plans, and I&#39;m really happy with that. I deploy my bowlers based on the wicket, and we tried to mix it around. The bowlers executed really well, and the team is sticking to the plans. At the halfway stage, I would have been happy with 160, considering the slow wicket and grip. MSD walking in put pressure on the bowlers, as he has had that intimidation factor on opposition bowlers. Our young bowlers were under pressure with the crowd going berserk as well, giving the opposition 15-20 extra runs. I&#39;ve been trying to assess the situation, and it came off today. I knew the CSK spinners would put pressure on, so I picked my bowlers accordingly. Quinton batted well too, making life easy for both of us. Playing in Chennai is a different ball game, especially in front of a mini Chennai crowd. As a young team, we&#39;re happy to play in front of such a crowd.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

With four defeats out of six games, they sit in eighth place, just ahead of Mumbai Indians, who are ninth with a similar loss count. Notably, five of Punjab&#39;s six games have concluded in the last over, underscoring their &quot;so close yet so far&quot; scenario. Ashutosh Sharma and Shahsank Singh have been standout performers, averaging 47.5 and 73, respectively, with strike rates above 180. Arshdeep Singh and Kagiso Rabada lead their bowling attack, each having claimed nine wickets, followed by Sam Curran with eight.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are reeling from a recent defeat against arch-rivals Chennai Super Kings. Sharing a similar plight as Punjab, Mumbai has secured only two wins in six games this season. Historically resilient, Mumbai Indians are eager to reverse their fortunes. Rohit Sharma&#39;s century in the last game, despite the loss, has been a highlight, making him the top scorer with 261 runs in six innings, while Ishan Kishan has contributed 184 runs. Jasprit Bumrah is crucial in their bowling lineup, having taken 10 wickets at an impressive economy rate of 6.08, with Gerald Coetzee adding nine wickets to his tally.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in IPL:</strong><br />\n<strong>In 31 matches contested between the two teams, Mumbai Indians edge over Punjab Kings with 16 wins to 15 wins.</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (5)_1713443737.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>IPL Stats at Maharaja Yadavindra Singh Stadium:</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>In the three matches played at this venue, pacers have dominated the bowling stats, securing 33 wickets compared to just eight by the spinners.

Additionally, Shreyas Gopal has established a promising rhythm against Jonny Bairstow, having dismissed him once in 21 deliveries while also conceding 21 runs.

Another tricky aspect is the shorter boundaries behind the wicket, just 58 and 56 meters, which will have players strategizing. The pitch also has a bit of green, which I like.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Anjum Chopra added her perspective on the implications for the bowlers, &quot;Given the pocket-sized boundaries, it&#39;s seemingly tough for the bowlers. However, this ground has been quite favourable for them. Yes, spinners have performed well, but it&rsquo;s the seamers who really made a mark in the last game by hitting hard lengths and troubling the batters. The seamers have excelled, which isn&#39;t great news for the batters.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Danny also noted, &quot;The average first innings score here is 168.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Anjum concluded, &quot;While that&#39;s a decent score, teams might want a bit more on the board given the conditions. It&#39;s a good batting surface, but the visible grass will tempt the seam bowlers.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024_1713448255.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS UPDATE : <span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://assets.bcci.tv/watermarkoutput/bcci/photos/1415/8a3859fd-0c5b-41c9-b97e-08d2f2feefbc.jpg\" /><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sam Curran&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first, following the current trend here.

Despite this, we&#39;re getting a lot right at the moment. Jonny Bairstow misses out today, and Rilee Rossouw will take his place.

We&#39;ve had our chances in previous games but failed to capitalize. The IPL really tests you. We&#39;re not being too harsh on ourselves; we need to accept things as they are and ensure we give our 100% every time we step out on the field.

However, a solid partnership between Rohit and SKY steadied the ship. SKY then continued the momentum alongside Tilak Varma, adding another 49 runs. Late cameos from David and Pandya pushed the total to a respectable 193. Harshal Patel and Sam Curran kept things tight for Punjab with three and two wickets respectively, but the score proved challenging nonetheless.&nbsp;Punjab&#39;s chase began disastrously. They were in tatters at 14-4 after just 2.1 overs. Hope seemed lost as wickets continued to tumble, leaving them at a precarious 77-6 by the 10th over.&nbsp;Enter Ashutosh, the unlikely hero! In a stunning display of power hitting, he blazed a trail of destruction with a blistering 28-ball 61. Helicopter pulls, audacious sixes off Bumrah and Madhwal - Ashutosh, alongside Shashank, brought Punjab back into the contest. With MI gasping for air, victory seemed within reach for the Kings.&nbsp;But alas, it wasn&#39;t meant to be. Just when Punjab sniffed victory, Ashutosh holed out in the deep, leaving them 25 runs short of the target. The lower order couldn&#39;t manage the chase, and Mumbai&#39;s bowlers, led by the ever-reliable Bumrah, ensured their side crossed the finish line. Bumrah, with his miserly spells and crucial wickets, once again proved his worth as Mumbai&#39;s death-overs ace.&nbsp;Ashutosh&#39;s heroics and Shashank&#39;s gritty knock threatened to rewrite the script, but Bumrah remained unfazed. He also topped the purple cap list again&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/purple-cap.png\" style=\"height:24px; width:24px\" title=\"\" />. However, it was a fiery spell from the young Coetzee that ultimately swung the momentum back in Mumbai&#39;s favour.

This team seems to thrive on close matches. Credit to Ashutosh for getting us so close; his effort was exceptional. Losing close games is always tough, especially when you&#39;ve been losing early wickets consistently throughout the tournament. It&#39;s heartbreaking for the guys to come so close and still end up on the losing side. Ashutosh and Shashank showed incredible confidence in their game; Ashutosh&#39;s ability to sweep fast bowlers is impressive. Hopefully, we can turn these close encounters into wins and build some momentum. It&#39;s been a roller-coaster ride, winning one game and then losing the next. I&#39;d rather lose close matches than get completely outplayed.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;captain: &quot;It was indeed a very good game of cricket. Everyone&#39;s nerves were put to the test. We discussed before the game that our character would be tested, and that&#39;s exactly what happened. Even though you feel you&#39;re ahead in the game, the IPL has a way of producing these close encounters. Ashutosh&#39;s knock was unbelievable - he was hitting almost every ball in the middle. I&#39;m happy for him and excited for his future. During the timeout, we emphasized that it doesn&#39;t matter how good we look; we need to keep scrapping in this game. There were moments where we were a bit soft, but in the end, a win is a win.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/purple-cap.png\" style=\"height:24px; width:24px\" title=\"\" />, Player of the Match: &quot;It was a closer game than we anticipated. Naturally, as a bowler, you want to make an impact when conditions favour the ball. In this format, the ball swings for only a couple of overs, unlike Test cricket where I can bowl more and have a greater influence. T20 cricket presents challenges for bowlers due to time constraints and rules favouring impact players. The batting lineups also tend to become deeper, which is beyond our control. I try to relay messages to the bowlers when possible, but I also avoid overloading them with information during the heat of the moment.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Gujarat Titans are set to host Delhi Capitals in match number 32 of the TATA IPL 2024 at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on April 17th.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans enter the contest buoyed by a historic chase in their previous game, propelled by Shubman Gill&#39;s robust batting and a thrilling finish by Rashid Khan and Rahul Tewatia. Their tournament performance has been mixed, with three wins and three losses. Gill and Sai Sudharsan have been standout performers in the batting lineup, each scoring over 200 runs in six games with commendable strike rates. However, Mohit Sharma and Umesh Yadav, despite taking 8 and 7 wickets respectively, have struggled with high economy rates over 9. The confident Titans aim to extend their winning streak.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi Capitals, placed second from the bottom with two wins in six games, come into this match after a scintillating victory against Lucknow Super Giants. They not only won but did so in spectacular fashion, becoming the first team to chase over 160 runs against LSG in the IPL. Debutant Jake Fraser McGurk made a sensational entry with a 35-ball 55, including five sixes, while Rishabh Pant and Tristan Stubbs continued their consistent run-scoring. Kuldeep Yadav&#39;s aggressive bowling was crucial in their last game. Despite their low ranking, DC is eager to climb the table by continuing to turn the tide in their favor.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in IPL:</strong><br />\nIn the three matches played between the two teams, Gujarat Titans have managed to win twice while Delhi Capitals have won once.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head to Head - 640 (6)_1713353096.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>IPL Stats at Narendra Modi Stadium (Since 2022):</strong><br />\nIn the 14 matches played here at this venue since 2022, the pace bowlers have picked up 118 wickets while the spinners have managed to pick 49 wickets. Teams Batting first have won six games while the teams chasing have won 8 games.

Additionally, the contest between Shubman Gill and Khaleel Ahmed also promises intrigue; in their four encounters, Gill has scored 38 runs off 25 balls but has been dismissed twice by Ahmed. These key battles could significantly influence the outcome of the match.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Battles to watch out for_1713353186.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nDaren Ganga &amp; Simon Katich: &quot;<strong> </strong>We&#39;re on pitch 4 for the first time this season, which is composed of 100% black soil. This setup typically results in a great batting pitch, as there&#39;s little grass and it doesn&#39;t offer much turn for the spinners. The square boundaries measure 61m and 72m, while the straight hit extends to 75m. It&#39;s a scorching 41 degrees today, and with such high temperatures, dew might become a significant factor as the game progresses. This will definitely be something the captains consider when deciding whether to bat or bowl first after winning the toss&quot;.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2024-04-17T185721_1713360572.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.bcci.tv/watermarkoutput/bcci/photos/1413/8ce2affa-2292-44e4-8b9c-64d7c2113d29.jpg\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh Pant,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first. Given it&#39;s an unknown wicket and our batting lineup is strong, we prefer to chase. We anticipate some dew later, which could influence the game. We&#39;re focused on playing solid cricket, taking it one match at a time. While our death bowling has been a concern, our bowlers are improving with each game. We&#39;re aiming to build momentum. The team remains largely unchanged for this match, with David Warner sitting out and Sumit Kumar returning to the lineup.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We would have chosen to bowl first as well, given it looks like a favorable wicket. Interestingly, there was no dew last night, and we&#39;re hoping for the same conditions today. Despite some losses, we&#39;ve been playing well but just haven&#39;t capitalized on crucial moments. We&#39;re excited about the magnificent stadium atmosphere and the excellent support we expect here. We&#39;re making three changes to our lineup: Saha and Miller are back, and Sandeep Warrier will be making his debut, stepping in for Umesh Yadav.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Bowling, fielding, and captaincy - everything clicked for Delhi today. Rishabh Pant&#39;s decision to bowl first, though initially hesitant, proved to be a stroke of genius. The Delhi bowlers, led by the experienced Ishant Sharma, exploited the slow pitch conditions perfectly. Some deliveries kept low, creating problems for the GT batsmen. While the spinners found some grip, the majority of the GT dismissals were self-inflicted due to poor shot selection.&nbsp;This is Gujarat Titans&#39; lowest total in IPL history! Their previous lowest score of 125, coincidentally, also came against Delhi Capitals in Ahmedabad last year. Rashid Khan&#39;s valiant 31 was a lone bright spot in an otherwise disastrous batting display for GT.&nbsp;Mukesh Kumar emerged as the star bowler for Delhi, grabbing a well-deserved three wickets for a mere 14 runs. Fraser-McGurk, the young opener, threatened a quick chase but was dismissed by Spencer Johnson. Sandeep Warrier chipped in with a couple of wickets as well.&nbsp;Delhi, always keeping an eye on the Net Run Rate, ensured they wrapped up the innings quickly. They finished the chase in just 8.5 overs, giving their NRR a significant boost while simultaneously depleting Gujarat&#39;s.&nbsp;This comprehensive victory sees a massive shakeup in the points table! The Capitals climb from ninth to a much more comfortable sixth position, while the Titans slide down from sixth to seventh. A big day for Delhi, a day to forget for Gujarat!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/GTvDC_1713374950.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh Pant,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper and Player of the match: &quot;There&#39;s a lot to be pleased about today. We&#39;ve been focusing on adopting a champion&#39;s mindset, and I&#39;m really happy to see our team embody that on the field. Our bowling was definitely one of the best performances thus far. It&#39;s still early in the tournament, so there&#39;s room for individual improvement. My main focus, coming back from rehab, was just to return better than before. Before the chase, we discussed aggressively going after the target to make up for earlier losses in run rate. We love playing in Ahmedabad&mdash;the stadium and the vibe here are fantastic, and we&#39;re looking forward to more games in this environment. Right now, we want to enjoy this victory, take it one game at a time, and continue learning and improving.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Shubman Gill,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Our batting was quite average today, and it&#39;s crucial that we move past this and come back stronger. The pitch itself was alright; the dismissals were more about poor shot selection than anything else. With the opposition chasing just 89, they were obviously in a strong position&mdash;unless we had something extraordinary like a double hat-trick. We&#39;re only at the halfway mark of the season, having won three games so far. Based on our track record from the last couple of years, we&#39;re hopeful to secure another 5-6 wins from our next seven matches.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Both teams enter the contest fresh off victories in their previous fixtures.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Kolkata Knight Riders are currently second in the table, having won four out of their five games; their sole loss came against Chennai Super Kings in their fourth game. The strategy of opening with Sunil Narine has paid dividends in the early stages of the games, as he has scored 167 runs in five games, averaging over 33 with a strike rate above 180. His opening partner, Phil Salt, has been the leading run-scorer for the team, amassing 191 runs at an average of 47.25. Their bowling unit has been robust, led by Vaibhav Arora and Andre Russell, who have claimed 6 wickets in three and five games, respectively. Mitchell Starc regained his form in the last game, picking up three wickets. They aim to maintain their winning streak.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other hand, Rajasthan Royals enter the contest riding high on confidence, having won five of their six games, currently holding the top position in the table. Riyan Parag has been a key player, contributing 284 runs in six innings at an average of 71. Captain Sanju Samson has also been in fine form, scoring 266 runs.

It&#39;s a clash of the table-toppers, promising a high-octane match. The field dimensions here vary significantly, with a 12-meter difference square of the wicket&mdash;59 meters to the right and 71 meters to the left, with the straight boundary at 75 meters. Bowlers will likely focus on defending the bigger side. Michael, we&#39;ve seen diverse outcomes here; what&#39;s your take on today&#39;s pitch?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarke: &quot;The conditions are similar to the previous game. We thought 190 was a standard score during the day. Tonight, dew will likely play a role, making teams prefer chasing. It&rsquo;s a fantastic surface, complemented by a very quick outfield and fairly even boundaries. It&rsquo;s an excellent pitch that favors batting at any point, especially with the new ball when the pitch is hardest.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Badree: &quot;Considering the impact of bowlers like Sunil Narine, who has been economical here, how should teams approach facing him?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarke: &quot;Narine stands out as a key bowler for KKR, challenging batters who struggle to read him. The key against him is to watch his hand closely. Batters must pick the ball from his hand, which is easier said than done but essential for success against his spin.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2024-04-16T185433_1713274115.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nTOSS:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#990066\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color:#ff0099\"> WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-04-16T193455_1713276350.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>Sanju Samson <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper :&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We&#39;ve chosen to bowl first.

It was a night of spectacular performances and heart-stopping moments culminating in a last-ball thriller. The game kicked off with KKR&#39;s decision to bat first, a move that saw Sunil Narine stepping up in a big way. The Trinidadian exploded with a fiery century, scoring 109 runs that included a barrage of boundaries. His maiden IPL century left the Royals&#39; spinners, including veterans like Ashwin and Chahal, scrambling for answers.&nbsp;Rajasthan&#39;s chase began promisingly with Yashasvi Jaiswal giving the team a brisk start. However, the innings soon encountered turbulence as wickets fell at regular intervals. Sanju Samson and Riyan Parag tried to stabilize the inning with Buttler on one end, but their efforts were insufficient to keep the required rate in check. Just when all seemed lost, Jos Buttler took charge in a display of sheer determination and skill. Alongside Rovman Powell, who contributed with a quickfire cameo, Buttler steered the chase back on track. The duo&#39;s vital partnership breathed new life into RR&#39;s innings, setting the stage for a dramatic finale. The match reached its climax in the final over. Buttler, standing firm and undeterred, struck a crucial six early in the over before playing it smart with a calculated single in the last ball.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-04-17T000928_1713293437.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; Skipper: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough pill to swallow. I didn&rsquo;t foresee this scenario. Cricket&rsquo;s unpredictable nature struck again. Despite the setback, it&rsquo;s a learning curve for us. Narine was exceptional with his momentum-building innings at the top. With Buttler striking cleanly, we tried slowing it down by giving Varun the last over, hoping the lack of pace would help, but it&rsquo;s challenging with five inside the circle. We need to relax, reflect, and come back stronger after a tough, humid game.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff0099\">Sanju Samson<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper : &ldquo;We&rsquo;re thrilled with the win despite the early wickets we lost. Rovman Powell&rsquo;s crucial hits and Jos Buttler&rsquo;s consistent brilliance were instrumental. Facing quality spinners like Narine and Varun on this pitch was tough, but lucky breaks helped us stay in the hunt. Buttler&rsquo;s innings, as always, was transformative, maintaining our belief in chasing any target.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nPLAYER OF THE MATCH: <span style=\"color:#ff0099\">JOS BUTTLER</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>Jos Buttler (Player of the Match): &ldquo;Maintaining belief was key today, especially when I struggled for rhythm.

A major concern for them has been the bowling department, which has managed to secure only 25 wickets in six games&mdash;tying with their counterparts, who have played one game fewer. Kohli, Dinesh Karthik, and Faf du Plessis have been the standout performers with the bat. The team has experimented with more than 15 players in an attempt to find the right combination.

If they lose, expect drama. It&#39;s interesting, the boundary dimensions here&mdash;57 meters off-side, 64 meters leg side, and 69 meters straight&mdash;are so compact they hardly impact the game.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Finch: &quot;Looking at the pitch, there&rsquo;s a lot of green grass, albeit patchy. This means for fast bowlers, some balls will zip and others will skid with the new ball. More intriguing is the amount of spin we&#39;ve seen here this season, more than any other venue. The pitch, with its dry spin and cracking surface, will likely favor the spinners as the game progresses. While there&#39;s some dew, it&rsquo;s not as significant as Wankhede, favoring the team batting second.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2024-04-15T192515_1713189375.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS: <span style=\"color:#000066\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-04-15T193521_1713189977.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>Faf du Plessis| <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We&#39;re set for a chase tonight, which has been typical this season.

Despite their valiant effort, RCB fell short by 25 runs while chasing down a mammoth 288 set by SRH.A brutal opening assault laid the foundation for Hyderabad&#39;s victory. Travis Head, in particular, was unstoppable, reaching his century in a mere 39 balls - the fourth-fastest in IPL history. The carnage continued as Heinrich Klaasen blitzed his way to a 23-ball fifty. Later cameos from Aiden Markram and the big-hitting Abdul Samad ensured SRH crossed the 280-run mark with ease, posting a record-breaking total of 287.RCB&#39;s chase started brightly with Faf du Plessis and Virat Kohli taking the attack to the bowlers. However, Kohli&#39;s dismissal triggered a collapse, and wickets quickly fell. Mayank Markande, the impactful substitute, and Pat Cummins stifled the chase with crucial wickets despite the pitch offering minimal assistance. Dinesh Karthik, though, provided a lone fightback with a scintillating 83 off just 35 balls, but his knock lacked support from the other end.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This match will be forever remembered for the sheer volume of runs scored. With a staggering 549 runs amassed, it rewrote the record books for the highest-scoring T20 match ever witnessed.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-04-15T234117_1713204701.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Travis Head (Man of the Match): &quot;After my innings, I took a shower and enjoyed some good food. The pitch played beautifully today. We received some insights from the groundsmen and knew we needed to adapt during the initial six overs. Our batting order was set up nicely, giving everyone the freedom to aggressively target the bowlers. Abhishek Sharma and I have a great partnership; we really complement each other and boost each other&rsquo;s confidence. I&rsquo;m really enjoying batting alongside him. As for how to bowl to me, I&#39;m not sure there&rsquo;s a straightforward strategy. Bowlers have tried various approaches, but nothing specific has stood out. While my technique might not be the prettiest, I&rsquo;m really pleased with how I struck the ball today.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins(SRH Skipper):&quot;I sometimes wish I was a batter, especially after a game like today. We had a similar experience against Mumbai, and I thought it wouldn&#39;t happen again, but here we are. You do your best as a bowler. Even an over where you concede just seven or eight runs can really impact the match significantly. Honestly, I&#39;ve stopped trying to predict how pitches will play here at Chinnaswamy. Despite appearances, they often turn out to be fantastic for batting. We&#39;ve secured four wins so far. It&#39;s really the freedom with which our players are performing that&#39;s been the highlight. It&rsquo;s great to see them continue to play with such liberty, and I&rsquo;m really pleased with how everyone is performing.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>Faf du Plessis(RCB Skipper): &quot;Yeah, it was definitely a quintessential T20 pitch. The amount of runs scored today was extraordinary, possibly a world record. So credit to us for staying in the fight and trying to keep up, although 270 isn&#39;t too far off. Behind the scenes, we&#39;ve been experimenting with different strategies to find what works best, but it&#39;s been tough. Cricket can be a merciless game. When you&#39;re struggling with confidence, there&#39;s really nowhere to hide on the field. We&#39;ve been tweaking our approach, like incorporating leg spin in the middle overs. In terms of batting, we&#39;ve pinpointed areas where we need to push harder, especially after the powerplay considering the high scores. Despite the resilience the team has shown, giving up 30-40 extra runs in our bowling was pivotal. After a game like this, it&#39;s crucial to take a break and clear our heads. The mental strain of such defeats is significant, and right now, it feels like we&#39;re facing an uphill battle.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The shorter boundary to the left is only about 59m, and it is 65m to the right. The previous game here was a high-scoring game, but when you venture longer into the tournament the wickets tend to play a bit differently. This surface is a lot drier and when you use the same pitch consecutively then the wicket will show some semblance of dry patches. It still looks like a beautiful wicket&quot;.</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (95)_1713104363.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">has won the toss and have elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image - 2024-04-14T193547_1713103561.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We would like to bowl first, dew will come into play.

Positioned at the bottom of the points table, they are desperate for a turnaround. Rishabh Pant, returning to the tournament after a year&#39;s hiatus, has been a notable performer. Tristan Stubbs leads their batting charts with 174 runs from five innings, followed by Warner and Pant who have contributed 158 and 153 runs, respectively. Prithvi Shaw displayed promising hitting against MI, but it only narrowed the margin of defeat. Their bowling has consistently let them down, with Khaleel Ahmed and Anrich Nortje leading the wicket tally at seven and six wickets, respectively.

Winning three of their four games, they are well-placed third in the points table. Nicholas Pooran and Quinton de Kock are key players in their batting lineup, amassing 178 and 145 runs respectively across four games, while KL Rahul has also contributed 126 runs.

As a bowler, you will be so happy to see such an expansive field. This ground has some of the longest boundaries and that&#39;s what you want to see with the kind of power that the batters exhume nowadays. As a spinner, I don&#39;t think you would enjoy this pitch as there&#39;s a lot more grass on this surface. Grass is being left on the pitches now to ensure they don&#39;t crumble and also because India has discovered so many new fast bowlers.

They clinched a 29-run victory defending a formidable total of 235 runs, thanks to an all-round performance from Sheperd, who blasted 32 runs in the final over and also snagged the crucial wicket of Warner. With contributions across the board and a bowling unit that picked wickets at regular intervals, MI is keen to maintain this winning streak.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other hand, Royal Challengers Bengaluru faces a challenging road ahead after losing four out of their five matches. The team has underperformed significantly compared to its potential, with Virat Kohli being the lone beacon of hope in what appears to be a faltering lineup. Currently donning the orange cap with 316 runs at an astonishing average of over 105, including a century, Kohli&#39;s efforts have yet to be matched by his teammates, as no other batter has managed to convert starts into substantial scores. Dinesh Karthik has shown flashes of form sporadically. The bowling department raises even more concerns, with Yash Dayal leading with 5 wickets across 5 games.

Despite an early setback with Kohli departing for a slow 3 off 9 balls, du Plessis and Will Jacks tried to stabilize the innings. It was Rajat Patidar&#39;s impressive 50 off 26 balls and Dinesh Karthik&#39;s explosive unbeaten 53 off 23 balls that propelled the team to a competitive score. Jasprit Bumrah was the standout bowler for Mumbai, picking up a fifer and effectively stifling the RCB batsmen&#39;s attempts to accelerate, supported by a disciplined bowling effort from the rest of the squad.</p>\n\n<p>The chase by Mumbai Indians was nothing short of spectacular, showcasing their batting depth and aggressive intent from the get-go. Ishan Kishan led the charge with a blistering 69 off 34 balls, while Suryakumar Yadav got back to form, contributing a quickfire 52 off 19 balls. Rohit Sharma also played a vital inning of 38 off 24 balls. The team&#39;s approach was assertive, ensuring that the required run rate was always within reach. The chase was characterized by a barrage of boundaries, with Mumbai Indians reaching the target comfortably with 27 balls to spare.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image_1712859183.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;It&#39;s a tough pill to swallow to be honest.

In this format, it&#39;s anyway very harsh on the bowlers so you need to have different skills. Can&#39;t be a one-trick pony. Everyone is doing research and data.

Stars like Kane Williamson, Shubman Gill, and Rashid Khan will be crucial for GT&#39;s aspirations to climb up the ranks and regain their championship.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h4><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> vs <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />: Head-to-Head Record</strong></h4>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>In the storied history of their encounters in the IPL, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> have faced each other a total of 5 times.

We saw here last time, this was the slowest out of all the surfaces on this block of wickets in Jaipur. For me, I&#39;ll look to play straight as a batter Because we know in Jaipur, there can be some movement with the new ball. But as it goes on, I expect it to get slower.

The innings was anchored by a magnificent unbeaten 68 from captain Sanju Samson, who, alongside Riyan Parag&#39;s explosive 76 off 48 balls, propelled the Royals to a competitive score. The duo&#39;s partnership was crucial after the early dismissals of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jos Buttler, who couldn&#39;t convert their starts into bigger scores. The innings was characterized by aggressive batting, with Rajasthan capitalizing in the latter half of their innings, setting a challenging target for the Titans.</p>\n\n<p>Gujarat Titans&#39; bowlers had a mixed outing, with Rashid Khan being the standout performer, taking the crucial wicket of Jos Buttler and maintaining an economical rate. Other bowlers, however, struggled to contain the Royals&#39; batters, particularly during the death overs.</p>\n\n<p>In response, Gujarat Titans showcased their batting prowess, reaching the target with 199-7 in 20 overs. The chase was marked by Shubman Gill&#39;s scintillating 72 off 44 balls, setting the tone for the Titans. Sai Sudharsan also contributed a valuable 35 at the top of the order. However, it was Rashid Khan&#39;s unbeaten 24 off 14 balls towards the end that ensured Gujarat crossed the line, amidst a tense finish.</p>\n\n<p>Rajasthan Royals&#39; bowlers, led by Kuldeep Sen and Yuzvendra Chahal, kept the match competitive, picking up crucial wickets at different stages. However, the depth in Gujarat&#39;s batting lineup and strategic run-chasing saw them through in a close finish.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image (11)_1712774862.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\">Sanju Samson, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;To be honest, it is very hard to speak after such a match. The Skipper has the hardest job to speak after losing the game and to tell where we lost is tough. Maybe after a few hours, I can figure out and tell what went wrong.

Mathematically both batters needed to hit 22 off 9 balls and that&#39;s how the thinking goes and if one batter goes berserk that will do it for us. I would have loved to finish the match, especially after spending time in the middle, but very happy with Rahul Tewatia and Rashid Khan for finishing the job for us.

They aim to maintain their momentum going into this game.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Sunrisers Hyderabad, sharing a similar trajectory with their counterparts, come from a victory against the defending champions by a convincing six-wicket margin, thanks to an all-round bowling performance followed by Abhishek Sharma&#39;s ruthless power hitting and Markram&#39;s anchoring knock. Pat Cummins &amp; co will be riding high on confidence and look to keep their momentum going. This match presents a battle between two middle-placed teams striving to climb up the table. Who will emerge on top with the two points?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Punjab Kings&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> vs Sunrisers Hyderabad&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Head-To-Head in IPL:</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/GIFF_1712670782.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\n&nbsp;T20 AT MULLANPUR:&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST: 11<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND: 10<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 146</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (73)_1712670805.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones Alert:</strong><br />\n3 - <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Jitesh Sharma</span></strong> (47) needs three fours to complete 50 fours in the league.<br />\n4 - <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sam Curran</span></strong> (46) needs four wickets to complete 50 wickets in IPL.<br />\n98 - <strong><span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Aiden Markram</span></strong> (902) needs 98 runs to complete 1000 runs in IPL.<br />\n7 - <strong><span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Heinrich Klaasen</span></strong> (43) needs seven sixes to complete 50 sixes in IPL.<br />\n4 -<strong><span style=\"color:#e67e22\"> Abhishek Sharma</span></strong> (46) needs four sixes to complete 50 sixes in IPL.<br />\n50 - <strong><span style=\"color:#e67e22\">T.Natarajan </span></strong>is all set to play his 50th IPL game.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#660000\">Deep Dasgupta and Simon Katich: &quot; This is the first evening IPL game at this venue. 63m and 70m are the square boundaries while the straight down the ground is 72m.

However, the anticipated return of young sensation Matheesha Pathirana, alongside the crafty bowling of Ravindra Jadeja and Deepak Chahar, could bolster their lineup, promising a strong comeback on their home turf.</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;On the other hand, Kolkata Knight Riders are Riding the Wave of Momentum.&nbsp;</strong>Under the astute leadership of Shreyas Iyer, KKR has been nothing short of sensational, showcasing a blend of aggressive batting and strategic bowling. Their unbeaten streak in the last three matches speaks volumes of their form and determination. The spin duo of Varun Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine, armed with their bag of tricks, is set to exploit Chennai&#39;s spin-friendly wicket, posing a significant challenge to CSK&#39;s batting aspirations. With the likes of Andre Russell and Venkatesh Iyer adding firepower to their lineup, KKR looks well-equipped to extend their winning momentum.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Battles to Watch out :&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>The clash between CSK&#39;s batting prowess and KKR&#39;s spin wizards will be a spectacle, with both teams looking to leverage Chennai&#39;s pitch conditions. <span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Shivam Dube&#39;</strong></span>s aggressive batting will be crucial for CSK to counter the spin threat posed by <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Narine and Chakravarthy</strong></span>.

Their victory over <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; wasn&#39;t just about superior skills but a demonstration of acute tactical awareness and execution that outclassed their opponents in every department. The turning point of the match undoubtedly came in the 7th over when Ravindra Jadeja, CSK&#39;s spin wizard, was introduced into the attack. With KKR off to a stable start and looking to build momentum, Jadeja&#39;s over was nothing short of a masterstroke. Claiming two crucial wickets in a single over, he not only broke the backbone of KKR&#39;s batting lineup but also significantly shifted the momentum in favour of CSK. His ability to bowl with precision and exploit the pitch conditions underscored the strategic planning behind his introduction at that juncture of the game. Following Jadeja&#39;s lead, the rest of the CSK bowling unit tightened the screws on KKR. The bowlers, backed by astute field placements, gave nothing away, showcasing discipline and control. The pressure created led to KKR&#39;s middle order crumbling, unable to find the boundary with regularity, and consequently being restricted to a below-par total of 137. <strong>CSK&#39;s Chase: A Mix of Caution and Aggression.&nbsp;</strong>In pursuit of a modest target, CSK approached the chase with a blend of aggression and tactical acumen. Ruturaj Gaikwad, leading from the front, notched up a vital half-century, his first as the captain of CSK, playing a captain&#39;s knock when it mattered the most. His innings were a mix of caution and calculated aggression, setting the tone for the chase. Shivam Dube&#39;s cameo further accelerated the pace, ensuring that the required run rate was always within control. Dube&#39;s ability to strike lusty blows, coupled with Gaikwad&#39;s anchoring role, exemplified CSK&#39;s batting depth and their ability to pace the innings according to the match situation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />Skipper:</span> <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">&quot; &nbsp;It&#39;s deafening out here, but I&#39;ll try to express. We got a great start in the powerplay, but we lost consecutive wickets which tilted the momentum. We weren&#39;t able to assess the conditions quickly after the powerplay and thus scoring runs wasn&#39;t easy. They very well know the conditions and did pretty well to assess the same, they bowled according to their plans. It Wasn&#39;t easy for the new batters to go after the bowlers from the first ball. We were trying to construct the innings, but it didn&#39;t fall in place according to the plan and we fell short. We have to go back to the drawing board and got to learn from that.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;Little nostalgic for me. The same as my first IPL fifty, similar situation, Mahi bhai was with me and we finished the match. Tonight the pitch was slightly tricky, didn&#39;t want to put the side under pressure. Was a 150-160 wicket. With this team I don&#39;t need to tell anything to anyone. In T20 sometimes you need little bit of luck to get going.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja is Player of the Match&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja: &quot; I always enjoy my time here, and love to bowl.

With consistent dimensions around the square, batters have the opportunity to play freely. However, the slightly shorter boundary towards fine leg could indeed become a strategic focal point for the teams. Given LSG&#39;s history with GT, adapting their game plan to these conditions will be crucial. Overall, expect a competitive clash with plenty of runs and strategic bowling to counteract the boundary dimensions.&quot;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE: <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BAT&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Choosing to bat first on this promising wicket.

It was just a really poor batting performance from us. We got a decent start but we lost it in the middle overs and we were never able to get back to momentum or we were never able to recover from that. To restrict them to 160 on a wicket like this was impressive. We were expecting them to score around 175-180, but to limit them to 160 was a tremendous effort by the bowlers. Our batters let us down.Talking about Miller, he&#39;s the kind of player who can change the game for you anytime. We had a couple of hinges in this game, but irrespective of that, this total was very gettable for us.I thought it was the last over of the power play. We got off to a decent start. I just wanted to capitalize on the last over of the power play. With everyone up on the offside, I wanted to give myself a bit of room. As for the ball I got out to, I was actually trying to play it a bit square, but I missed it.He&#39;s (Umesh Yadav) someone who&#39;s very experienced, and even Darshan, the way our bowlers bowled in this game, as I&#39;ve already mentioned, was tremendous to watch. They got off to a decent start, and to restrict them to around 160-165 runs was what we were hoping for.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">KL Rahul&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We&#39;ll take the win, I am not going to make too much out of it. I think for the young bowling group that we have, it helps when we bat first and they get a bit of an idea of how the wicket&#39;s playing and they&#39;ve also been adapting really well. [On 100% record of defending 160+ total] Yeah, it&#39;s a good record to have, obviously. But I also think it&#39;s because of where we&#39;ve played and the conditions. Last time we played here in Lucknow, the wickets were very low-scoring, and it&#39;s a low-scoring ground. So, we defended quite well there. Having that home advantage obviously helps a little bit. And yes, I mean, the bowlers have come through the ranks in the last couple of years. You&#39;ve seen the same guys playing last season as well, and they&#39;ve adjusted to their roles. They&#39;re reading the wickets really well. That&#39;s something that I try to discuss with them a lot more off the field and even during practice.</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Player of The Match: Yash Thakur</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I am happy for the first 5-wicket haul and first player of the match award.

Unfortunate to lose Mayank bhai but the skipper told me that its your day and you will win us the game.Last 2 seasons we never won against them so very happy to win against them today.

Starting with the outfield, it&#39;s in pristine condition, allowing for ground shots instead of just lofted hits. The square boundaries measure 63 and 62 meters, while the straight boundary stretches to 74 meters, the longest here. Turning our attention to the pitch, I&#39;ve got Simon Katich with me. Simon, what&#39;s your take on the pitch?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Katich: &quot;We&#39;re looking at pitch number seven today, and it&#39;s as hard as concrete. It&#39;s the same strip from the recent game against Rajasthan Royals, where Trent Boult showcased his swing bowling prowess. However, with today&#39;s hotter conditions, I&#39;m anticipating a high-scoring game. The pitch has a covering of grass, but it&#39;s really set up for the batsmen. Last year, we saw four centuries scored here, and many of Mumbai&#39;s batsmen relish playing at the Wankhede.

Their bowling attack, a miserly metronome led by Boult and Chahal, has been a revelation. Explosive batting from Parag and skipper Samson&#39;s experience provide the firepower. But all eyes are on the silent giants &ndash; Buttler and Jaiswal. A big knock from either could send shivers down RCB&#39;s spine.RCB, on the other hand, are desperate to turn things around. With a solitary win in four, their campaign is riddled with inconsistency, especially from their star-studded batting line-up.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThis clash promises a fascinating battle between contrasting bowling attacks. However, RR&#39;s&nbsp; bowling mastery, currently the best in the IPL, could be RCB&#39;s lower order&#39;s undoing. The explosive Shimron Hetmyer, often used as a late-innings finisher by RR, could be the game-changer. If he unleashes his six-hitting prowess against RCB&#39;s leaky death bowling, it could be curtains for the Challengers. Jaipur has been a happy hunting ground for RR, with two wins coming at home.

Previously, this pitch has seen scores around 180. It&#39;s a large ground, with boundaries at 69 meters on the right and 63 meters on the left, while straight down the ground it stretches to 76 meters. So, the pitch must be the high-scoring enabler. Joining me is WV Raman. WV, your insights on this pitch?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Raman: &quot;This pitch mirrors the typical conditions found here&mdash;hard with a hint of grass. It&#39;s well-maintained, promising high-scoring affairs. Fast bowlers can look forward to some extra bounce with the new ball, yet it&#39;s not all challenging for the spinners. This surface, in particular, offers more turn, around 2.2 degrees, more than the usual 1.8 degrees on other pitches at this venue.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Dasgupta: &quot;WV points this out because upon close inspection, the grass is quite patchy. There are spots completely devoid of grass, and then there are grassy patches.&quot;<br />\nRaman: &quot;Indeed, and despite the dry patches, the spinners can be heartened by the bigger boundaries compared to other venues, giving them a unique advantage.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (56)_1712411869.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PLAYER BATTLES TO LOOK OUT FOR&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">Virat Kohli </span>vs <span style=\"color:#990033\">Sandeep Sharma</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#990033\">Jos Buttler</span> vs <span style=\"color:#000066\">Mohammed Siraj</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">Glenn Maxwell</span> vs <span style=\"color:#990033\">Yuzvendra Chahal&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#990033\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (95)_1712412321.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#990033\">WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#990033\">Sanju Samson |&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first on this pitch.

The toss favored&nbsp; the host, who decided to field first. Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis unleashed a storm against RR, crafting a dazzling century partnership for the opening wicket until Chahal struck, providing the much-needed breakthrough for RR. Following this, RR tightened their bowling, ramping up the pressure on RCB.

However, the formidable duo of Samson and Buttler swiftly turned the tide, weaving together a stellar 100-run partnership.

We aimed for 190, but fell short by 10-15 runs towards the end, especially with their spinners making it tough in the middle overs. Despite our efforts, hitting was difficult, with many shots not connecting as intended.</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">Virat was in fine form, and with partners like Green or DK, we aimed to capitalize in the final overs, given our wicket reserve. However, the pitch improved, and the dew made conditions better for batting, which was an advantage for them. We started well in the powerplay but a costly over shifted momentum.</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">Opting not to bowl Maxwell was strategic, given the two right-handed batsmen at the crease, preferring Mayank&#39;s form this season. The decision for a leg-spinner as an impact player was to target a breakthrough, reserving Maxwell for a potential left-hander.</span></strong><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">Fielding was below par, and although catches are crucial, the overall energy and commitment on the field were lacking, which we&#39;ve discussed.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#990033\"><strong>Sanju Samson&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper&nbsp;</strong></span><span style=\"color:#990033\"><strong>&quot;Considering the conditions, a score below 190 was within our reach, especially with our batting lineup and the anticipated dew.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#990033\"><strong>With a few games ahead and a break allowing for rest and recovery, we&rsquo;re optimistic. On rating our bowling and batting, I&rsquo;d say our bowling is a 9 and batting an 8.7.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#990033\"><strong>Jos Buttler&rsquo;s form was key; knowing if he got past the powerplay, the game could tilt in our favor.

The <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sunrisers Hyderabad</span>, battling a case of the yips at the crease (all starts, no big scores) and a bowling attack that&#39;s as reliable as a fidget spinner, are hungry to snap their losing streak. But standing in their way are the mighty<span style=\"color:#d35400\"> </span><span style=\"color:#e67e22\">Chennai Super Kings</span>, still licking their wounds from their first defeat this season. This Hyderabad pitch, though, could throw a real bouncer.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Forget the usual six-fests Hyderabad has witnessed this season &ndash; that black soil might morph into a spinner&#39;s paradise, leaving CSK&#39;s new ball wizards, used to their zippy swing, with a case of the wobbly seam. Don&#39;t expect those clean hitters to have it easy either; they&#39;ll need to be on their toes for some surprise doosras and slower balls that could leave them bamboozled like a rabbit in the headlights.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This match is as hard to predict as a googly gone right. Will CSK&#39;s experience and championship pedigree rise to the occasion, or will the Orange Army, fueled by the roar of the home crowd, pull off a heist? The key lies in who reads the pitch quicker and adapts their batting like a chameleon. One team might come out swinging for the fences, while the other might need to play the sheet anchor role and build a platform. Don&#39;t blink for a second, folks, because this match promises fireworks &ndash; the kind that could see boundaries raining down like monsoon showers or a nail-biting finish that goes down to the wire, leaving everyone on the edge of their seats.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in IPL&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:29px; width:79px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; VS&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:31px; width:82px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl 2024 Notification Temp_1712324421.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stats at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (49)_1712324552.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nPitch Report :&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Samuel Badree and Brian Lara at the Pitch Report: Badree: &quot;We&#39;re feeling the buzz here at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, ready for an electrifying southern derby between CSK and SRH. The dimensions are interesting here; one side&#39;s a bit longer, with square boundaries under 70 meters and longer straight hits. Records were shattered last week on this ground. Joining me is Brian Lara. What do you make of it?&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lara: &quot;Looks like we&#39;ve got a different pitch today, but it&#39;s ripe for scoring. There are some visible cracks, though I doubt they&#39;ll impact the game significantly. The skipper who wins the toss would likely opt to bat, eyeing a hefty score. We could be looking at a match where even 10 runs an over might not suffice. In my view, anything less than 200 might fall short on this fabulous batting wicket. Expect a bit of pace for the quicks initially, but overall, it&#39;s a dream track for batters.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (51)_1712325576.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">WON THE TOSS AND CHOOSE TO FIELD&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (80)_1712325895.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nPat Cummins | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We&#39;ve opted to field first.

With a couple of away games coming up after this, winning tonight is crucial, especially considering our performance in away games last year.We&#39;re making a single change in our lineup; Miller is out with a minor issue, and Kane will be taking his place.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Set a daunting target of 200 runs, thanks to Shubman Gill&#39;s unbeaten 89, the Kings chased valiantly, led by a whirlwind 61* off 29 balls from Shashank Singh and a crucial 31 off 17 balls from Ashutosh Sharma.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Both teams displayed exceptional batting skills, keeping the scoreboard ticking. However, it was the boundaries, especially the sixes, that proved decisive. Punjab&#39;s middle and lower order, defying Gujarat&#39;s bowling attack, emerged as the unlikely heroes.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The turning point came in Noor Ahmad&#39;s spell, where he scalped two crucial wickets for Gujarat. But the Kings&#39; lower order, with their fearless hitting, kept them in the hunt. The Penultimate ball of the match saw a tense scramble, with Punjab emerging victorious by a narrow margin of 3 wickets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>Shubman Gill | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;The dropped catches really set us back. Our bowlers, though, did their job well. It&#39;s challenging to defend totals with the dew factor.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>I wouldn&#39;t say we were 20 runs short. The ball had some movement early on. There&#39;s always room for improvement, but 199 was a competitive score. We were right in it until the 15th over. However, those missed catches...</strong></span><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>Choosing Darshan (Nalkande) was straightforward given his performance in the last game against Sunrisers Hyderabad. He was the clear pick.That&#39;s the thrill of the IPL for you. There are always players who step up and deliver unexpectedly. It&#39;s what makes this league so special.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan |&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Captain: &quot;What a thrilling game it was, coming down to the wire, but our team held on to clinch it. Our strategy was to attack from the get-go. Despite my early departure, we made the most of the powerplay. Maintaining a positive intent is key, and Shashank epitomized that with his outstanding play.In chasing a hefty total, keeping up the momentum is crucial. Shashank&#39;s sixes seemed almost effortless, a joy to have on our side. His timing and ability to finish the game highlighted his skill, especially considering his hiatus from the IPL. His performance from batting at number seven to now showcases his strong mindset.</strong></span><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>I also want to acknowledge Ashutosh. Watching him stay composed under pressure and perform well was impressive.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>PLAYER OF THE MATCH: </strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>SHASHANK SINGH&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shashank Singh : &quot;It&#39;s surreal, almost like I visualized all of this before the match. To see it happen is a fantastic feeling. I&#39;m proud of myself. Focusing on playing proper cricket shots, I just aimed to watch the ball closely and react. That was the coach&#39;s advice. Usually, I bat at number 7, but today I was at 5, so it was about playing each ball on its merit.The pitch was excellent, offering good bounce. With both teams scoring 200, it&#39;s clear the wicket was prime for batting.Facing bowlers like Rashid Khan, who are considered cricket legends, I step up believing I&#39;m the best in the world. It&#39;s all about reacting to the ball.This experience means a lot. I didn&#39;t get many opportunities before. My time with SRH was valuable, but here, the coaching staff, management, and owners have shown great faith in me during practice sessions, boosting my confidence.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Picture this: the vibrant city of Visakhapatnam, the stage is set, the lights are dazzling, and the crowd is buzzing with anticipation.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi Capitals, after a rollercoaster start, have flipped the script with a thrilling victory against the defending champs, Chennai Super Kings. Warner and Shaw at the helm, setting the tone, while Pant, back with a bang, delivers a powerhouse performance. This squad&#39;s comeback has been nothing short of a blockbuster. But hold up, because on the other side, we&#39;ve got the Kolkata Knight Riders, unbeaten gladiators, showcasing a blend of brute force and tactical finesse. Narine&#39;s explosive cameo and Venkatesh Iyer&#39;s classy half-ton in their previous match? Pure gold!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, as these Titans gear up for a clash that&#39;s got everyone on the edge of their seats, it&#39;s not just about the runs or the wickets; it&#39;s about making a statement. With DC&#39;s balanced attack squaring off against KKR&#39;s dynamite lineup, we&#39;re in for a cricketing spectacle loaded with nail-biting moments and heart-thumping action.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>So, strap in, folks. Whether you&#39;re Team Delhi, rooting for that strategic masterclass, or Team Kolkata, all about that unbeatable streak, one thing&#39;s for sure &ndash; this clash is going to light up the night sky. Let the games begin!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report | Ian Bishop :&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;I&#39;m absolutely delighted to be here in Visakhapatnam, surrounded by the beauty of this fantastic stadium. The weather is pleasantly cool, making for a comfortable environment. This ground isn&#39;t the largest, which is evident from the boundary dimensions &ndash; 60 meters square on both sides. For a right-hander, behind me, the distance is even shorter at 53 meters, making it quite easy to notch up a few quick runs to that boundary. The deep third man stands at 59 meters. Given that KKR, known for their high six-hitting capabilities, is in town, we&#39;re in for a thrilling match.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Examining the pitch, it&#39;s extremely well-maintained and incredibly firm. The lack of live grass suggests that spinners might find it challenging to extract much deviation or manipulate the pace and line effectively.This element will definitely add an exciting dimension to tonight&#39;s game.The pitch appears to offer a balanced surface throughout. I&#39;m hopeful it will remain consistent, allowing the batsmen to execute a full range of shots. Let&#39;s anticipate a game rich with sixes this evening.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (10)_1712151059.png\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nBalancing Act: Strategy and Fortune&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>At the picturesque Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam, the battleground of the IPL reveals a unique narrative: a perfect balance between teams winning batting first and second, with 7 victories each across 14 matches. This equilibrium underscores the venue&#39;s unbiased pitch, which neither favours the chasers nor the defenders, presenting an open field for teams to strategize and adapt. Delhi Capitals, with a history of 8 matches, have won 3 and lost 5, indicating a quest for consistency, whereas Kolkata Knight Riders, having played only once and faced defeat, eye redemption.<br />\n<br />\nAs both teams gear up for their next clash in this evenly-poised venue, it&rsquo;s the blend of strategy, execution, and perhaps a dash of fortune, that will dictate the day.</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head to Head&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl 2024 Notification Temp_1712152832.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE :&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:39px; width:68px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BAT&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image - 2024-04-03T193821_1712153341.png\" /></span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;We&#39;ve decided to take the bat first today. Upon arrival, it was clear that the pitch presented an excellent batting opportunity. Moreover, we observed significant changes in the pitch behavior during the last game, prompting our decision to bat first.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>My tenure with Delhi was exceptional, and now, being with Kolkata, I&#39;ve received immense support from both the staff and management. I&#39;m really looking forward to the game tonight.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Truthfully, cricket is unpredictable; anything can happen on any given day. Each team poses unique challenges, making it crucial to remain focused and perform our best every time we step onto the field. We&#39;ve strategically adjusted our lineup, promoting Sunil to bat in the powerplay. His task is to aggressively take on the bowlers, a role he clearly understands. Similarly, every other player knows their importance. They&#39;re aware they&#39;re champions in their own right, and the importance of adhering to their roles cannot be overstated.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishab Pant | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;We would have chosen to bat first as well, since the pitch might turn slower in the second innings. But, we&#39;re not too worried about that. It&#39;s great to be back with the team. We&#39;re not looking too far ahead, just taking things as they come. The bowlers really stepped up during the Powerplay, and we came together well as a team. Our batting needs to pick up a bit too.

KKR&#39;s batting masterclass laid the foundation for their win, with a record-breaking 272 runs on the board (2nd highest IPL total).<br />\nTheir dominance was evident in a staggering 73.53% boundary percentage (fours and sixes) and a minimal 29.75% dot ball percentage, showcasing their aggressive intent and minimal time spent without scoring.

This clinical bowling performance, featuring impressive debuts from Vaibhav Arora (3/27) and impactful spells from Varun Chakaravarthy (3/33) and Mitchell Starc (2/25), ensured KKR&#39;s emphatic win and their historic feat of winning their opening three IPL matches for the first time ever.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Rishabh Pant | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; skipper: &quot;Today was a bit off for us with the ball; we know we could have performed better. It&#39;s just one of those days, really. As for our batting strategy, we&#39;re all about chasing aggressively. We believe it&#39;s better to fall trying than to fall short without giving it our all. The noise at the venue made it tough to see the DRS timer, plus there were some technical glitches too. But, some things are in our control and some aren&#39;t&mdash;we just roll with it. Now&#39;s the time for us to regroup, reflect, and come back stronger.

We aimed for 210-220, but hitting 270 was just phenomenal. As I mentioned before, Sunny&#39;s role is to give us a solid start, and it&#39;s fine if it doesn&#39;t always work out. But today, he was absolutely fearless right from the start, and his attitude on the field is just outstanding. Watching him play is a treat. It&#39;s fantastic to see our bowlers stepping up when needed and making the most of their moments. Regarding the injury concern on the field, I can empathize; I&#39;ve been there. Vaibhav Arora really stood out tonight with his crucial wickets, truly stepping up for the team.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nPLAYER OF THE MATCH<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">: SUNIL NARINE&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sunil Narine: &quot;Ahh... I reckon cricket largely is about batting. Contributing more with the bat is always pleasing, both for me and the team. Yet, I find joy in my bowling. My philosophy is simple: Knowing less is often better. On a pitch as good as this, my aim was to maintain a tight line. The scoreboard pressure made things somewhat easier tonight. In summary, it was a comprehensive performance with the ball by the team. Taking wickets early with the new ball and controlling the scoring rate was crucial.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>As Royal Challengers Bengaluru grapple with strategic dilemmas early in IPL 2024, their quest to fine-tune their bowling strategy amidst the high-scoring nature of their home venue becomes more pressing. With two losses in defensive stands and only one victory in a chase, the team faces the familiar scrutiny over its bowling capabilities. Ahead of their clash against the Lucknow Super Giants&mdash;a side that previously snatched a dramatic victory from their grasp&mdash;the challenge of overcoming the venue&#39;s inherent disadvantages looms large.Nicholas Pooran, pivotal in LSG&#39;s last-season win against RCB, steps up again amid speculation around KL Rahul&#39;s role due to fitness concerns. Boosted by a recent win against Punjab Kings and the spotlight on Mayank Yadav&#39;s pace prowess, LSG&#39;s confidence is high.RCB, on the other hand, pins hopes on its batting powerhouses like Faf du Plessis, Glenn Maxwell, and Rajat Patidar to make their mark. Amidst this, the bowling lineup seeks to reinforce its support for Virat Kohli, who is playing his 100th game in BengaluruLSG, similar to RCB in navigating early-season jitters, eyes continuity in victory. Both teams, poised at a crucial juncture, aim to shed their early inconsistencies. This confrontation at M.Chinnaswamy Stadium is not just a test of strategy and skill but also a momentous occasion marking Kohli&#39;s centenary of appearances, promising a duel rich in narratives and the potential for an epic showdown in IPL 2024&#39;s unfolding saga.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report | Murali Kartik and Graeme Swann : </strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Pitch number 7, previously seen in the game against Punjab Kings where 175 was scored, now shows an average first innings score of 196 in recent years. Immediately noticeable is its dryness, suggesting significant spin potential, particularly for Glenn Maxwell. In the recent clash between RCB and PBKS, spinners from both disciplines found turn on this surface. This year, it&#39;s emerged as the IPL&#39;s top spinner-friendly venue. Maxwell, and other spinners, will likely target the dry, crack-laden areas outside the right-handers&#39; off-stump, resembling a riverbed with interspersed grass patches. This could introduce variable bounce and turn, making it an intriguing pitch for spin bowling.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (6)_1712066841.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<br />\nHead-to-Head at Bengaluru</strong> &ndash;<strong> The single encounter between <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">RCB </span>and <span style=\"color:#000066\">LSG </span>at this venue saw the latter emerging victorious, setting the stage for a revenge saga this season.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:38px; width:68px\" title=\"\" /><strong>&nbsp;AND</strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:21px; width:80px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<strong> FORM IN IPL 2024</strong><br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; <strong><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">L</span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2ecc71\"> W&nbsp;</span></strong> <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>L</strong></span><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>L&nbsp;</strong></span> <span style=\"color:#2ecc71\"><strong>W&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (50)_1712066746.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n<br />\n<strong>TOSS : <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis: &quot;We&#39;ve decided to chase today.

Our team has shown great character in both matches so far. It&#39;s heartening to see everyone contributing, which boosts our confidence. We&#39;re getting better with every season, and our team combination is strengthening. Our goal now is to score substantial runs and apply pressure on the opposition. Beyond our victories, there&#39;s been a lot of talk about Mayank&#39;s pace. He&#39;s been a part of our team since the beginning and it was unfortunate he missed last season due to injury. We&#39;re making just one change today - Moshin Khan is out with a sore back, and Yash Thakur steps in.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Despite Rajat Patidar and Mahipal Lomror&#39;s efforts, their chase was constrained by efficient LSG bowling, underscored by Mayank Yadav&rsquo;s critical spell, taking 3 wickets with an economy of 3.50&nbsp;Yadav&#39;s early breakthroughs and economical spells kept RCB&#39;s batsmen in check, culminating in a spectacular catch by Pooran to dismiss Mohammed Siraj, emblematic of LSG&#39;s fielding superiority and sealing a well-fought victory.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis| <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper&nbsp;: &quot; Quinton de Kock and Nicky P were let off early, and that mistake cost us about 60-65 extra runs. In the IPL, errors like that can be quite expensive.Facing Mayank Yadav initially was a challenge due to his unique action. It takes a while for batters to adjust and understand the delivery. His pace was impressive, but even more so was his control over lengths, especially with that extra pace. Our bowling in the powerplay wasn&#39;t up to mark, too many deliveries played to their strengths. Maxwell did a great job pulling us back into the game, and we managed to restrict them towards the end. However, when chasing, building partnerships is crucial, and we failed to do that. We need to show some strong character in our next games to chase down totals successfully.&quot;&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">KL Rahul | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Overall, it was a solid team performance. The pitch offered some help for the fast bowlers, making it slightly tricky. By the time their bowlers figured out the right lengths to bowl, we had already put up a competitive score. We opted not to target the yorkers immediately, considering the pressure at Chinnaswamy can be overwhelming, and focused instead on bowling the right lengths.Keeping to Mayank Yadav was an experience, especially with one delivery hitting me quite hard. It&rsquo;s been fantastic watching Mayank&#39;s growth, especially after his patience through injury and training in Bombay.Regarding our record while defending, despite the trend in T20 to bowl first, our history suggests batting first works well for us. My strategy of losing the toss seems to work in our favor (laughs).<br />\nWe don&rsquo;t see setbacks in a negative light; it&rsquo;s all about how we stay engaged in the game. If we&rsquo;re outplayed, then it&rsquo;s a different discussion, but making mistakes is part of the game since the opposition also aims to win. Our focus is on improving our powerplay bowling, which has been a concern. This game we opted for spin, which worked well against their lineup, and we&rsquo;ll continue to work on taking early wickets.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>PLAYER OF THE MATCH : <span style=\"color:#000066\">MAYANK YADAV&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>Mayank Yadav: &quot;Winning the Player of the Match in two consecutive games feels great, but seeing my team win is even more satisfying.

Mumbai, seeking redemption and buoyed by their home crowd, is under the spotlight as Pandya navigates the challenges of his captaincy, distinct from his tenure with the Gujarat Titans.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The narrative for MI this season has been a tale of highs and lows, marked by a dramatic run-fest in Hyderabad and a poignant setback against their former leader&#39;s squad. Their strategy, especially in utilizing pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and contending with the highest-ever IPL team total posted by SRH, has been under scrutiny. Despite these hurdles, MI&#39;s resolve remains unshaken, with performances like Tilak Varma&#39;s half-century highlighting their potential to strike back.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajasthan Royals, on the other hand, have hit the ground running with a perfect start, showcasing a balanced attack that has outclassed opponents with both bat and ball. The promotion of Riyan Parag to number 4 has paid dividends, adding depth and firepower to their lineup. Yet, the Royals are not without their concerns, particularly around the form of explosive opener Jos Buttler, whose performance will be crucial as the tournament progresses.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>A telling statistic that shines a light on Pandya&#39;s evolving leadership is his increased role in opening the bowling, a strategy that underscores MI&#39;s adaptive approach but also calls for a reevaluation of tactics. Amidst the strategic debates, the unity and spirit within the MI camp remain steadfast, embodied by spinner Piyush Chawla&#39;s defense of their decisions under fire.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The showdown at Wankhede is more than just a match; it&#39;s a test of MI&#39;s resilience against RR&#39;s burgeoning dominance. With MI&#39;s historical knack for a comeback, especially on home turf, and RR&#39;s all-round prowess, led by the astute captaincy of Sanju Samson, the stage is set for an epic encounter. As Mumbai looks to ignite their campaign with a victory, Rajasthan aims to continue their winning streak, making this matchup a pivotal moment in IPL 2024&#39;s narrative.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Head to Head&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:22px; width:67px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;VS&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:33px; width:70px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl 2024 Notification Temp_1711977515.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPitch Report: (<u>Natalie Germanos and Brian Lara)</u></strong><br />\n&nbsp;<strong>Natalie Germanos sets the scene at Wankhede Stadium, highlighting pitch number seven&#39;s distinct characteristics with boundaries of 63m and 65m for right-handers, and a straight boundary of 74m, noting its absence from last year&#39;s IPL lineup. &quot;Brian, how do you assess this pitch?&quot; she inquires. Brian Lara, observing the pitch&#39;s verdant sheen and red soil, rich with grass, predicts, &quot;Teams bowling first should look to capitalize, but given this season&#39;s trend, we&#39;re in for a high run count. It&#39;s a batter&#39;s paradise, and while spinners might struggle, the high scores in powerplays suggest plenty of action.&quot; Germanos questions the home advantage, especially for Mumbai playing their first game at home. Lara reflects, &quot;Home advantage will indeed influence toss decisions. With the successes in defending and chasing seen so far, the team winning the toss and batting first might just have the upper hand.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (41)_1711979099.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stats At Wankhede Stadium:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (42)_1711979690.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<u>IN IPL 2024&nbsp;</u><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:22px; width:67px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">L L&nbsp;</span><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:33px; width:70px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#27ae60\">W W&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\nTOSS :&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:33px; width:70px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#990066\">Won the Toss and elected to Field First&nbsp;</span></strong><span style=\"color:#990066\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/image (41)_1711980444.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#990099\"><strong>Sanju Samson (<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper): &quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first, given the fresh condition of the wicket.

This emphatic victory, their third in a row, sees them climb to the top of the points table.<br />\nMumbai&#39;s struggles continued as they were bundled out for a mere 125/9. Trent Boult&#39;s fiery opening spell was the highlight, dismissing Rohit Sharma, Naman Dhir, and Dewald Brevis for first-ball ducks. Boult (3/22) was ably supported by Yuzvendra Chahal&#39;s (3/11) controlled spin in the middle overs, ensuring Mumbai never recovered.

Their bowling attack, particularly in the powerplay, has been exceptional. They&#39;ve taken the most wickets (9) in the first six overs this season, showcasing their early dominance. This aggressive approach has stifled opposition batting lineups, putting them on the back foot from the get-go.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Chasing a modest target, Rajasthan Royals stumbled initially, losing Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sanju Samson cheaply. However, the hero of their previous match, Riyan Parag (54*), emerged once again. Displaying a newfound maturity, Parag anchored the chase with a composed knock. Jos Buttler (13) and Ravichandran Ashwin (16) provided valuable support before falling. Despite losing wickets, the small target allowed the Royals to play with freedom.

However, this game&#39;s nature offers both challenges and opportunities, and I&rsquo;m not one to shy away from difficult pitches. It&rsquo;s about sticking to our strengths and maintaining discipline. Despite today&rsquo;s outcome, I have full faith in our comeback.

It played a pivotal role, especially with the conditions being quite challenging initially. Leveraging Trent Boult and Nandre Burger&#39;s expertise early on was key to our strategy.Their experience really shone through. Having Boult, with his extensive international cricket background, alongside Burger made a significant difference. Honestly, the early wickets were beyond our expectations, but their performances were exceptional.Our team is blessed with notable talents, yet it&#39;s the collective understanding of our role within the team that truly makes us stand out. Ashwin, for instance, adapting his bowling to the slowing pitch, exemplifies this perfectly, maintaining pressure during the crucial middle overs.There&#39;s a unique zeal within the squad to excel every IPL season. Watching Yuzvendra Chahal step up and deliver such an impactful performance tonight was a testament to that spirit.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<strong>PLAYER OF THE MATCH:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#990099\">TRENT BOULT&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nTrent Boult (POTM): &quot;Certainly, in this format, nothing&#39;s guaranteed, yet I&#39;m pleased to fulfil my role, especially taking wickets early on. Winning the toss and executing our plan set the tone, putting them under pressure right from the start. Facing Rohit, I always aim to mix it up; it&#39;s rewarding when the plan succeeds. Nandre Burger brings immense value with his confident South African bowling style, complementing our attack that includes consistent performers like Sandeep, Ashwin, and Chahal. It&#39;s an honour to be part of this unit.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Ishant Sharma&#39;s absence since the opener and Shai Hope&#39;s back spasm sidelining him in their last outing underscore their predicament.

A pleasant breeze is sweeping across the field, and we&#39;re positioned on pitch number 4, perfectly centered. The boundaries measure 62m on either side of the wicket and extend to 71m down the ground. The pitch sports an even grass cover, and the robust root structure is holding the soil well, indicating limited turn. It looks like a fantastic pitch for batting. While the average first innings score from games prior to 2019 hovered around 157, it&#39;s a bit outdated. We anticipate the current average first innings score to be in the range of 175-180. Bowlers will need to be strategic in their approach, leaning towards back of a length deliveries, varying pace, and employing cutters effectively.

The pitch seems promising, and we aim to maximize it with our batting. Our goal is to post a solid total and then effectively defend it with our bowling. Practicing here has made a significant difference. We&#39;re making two adjustments to our lineup today. Kuldeep Yadav is dealing with a minor issue, so he&#39;s out, and Prithvi Shaw will be taking his place. Ishant Sharma will be stepping in for Ricky Bhui.

The spectacle of Dhoni&#39;s late onslaught, while thrilling, wasn&#39;t enough to bridge the gap for Chennai Super Kings. From the outset, Delhi Capitals executed their game plan with precision, maintaining control over the proceedings. The target of 192, initially seen as reachable given the favorable pitch conditions and shorter boundaries, became a daunting task under the spell of Khaleel Ahmed&#39;s remarkable opening spell. Ahmed&#39;s prowess not only led to the dismissal of CSK&#39;s crucial openers but also showcased his dominance over a talent like Rachin, highlighting the effectiveness of his attack.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Throughout the game, Delhi Capitals balanced aggression with strategic play, setting a formidable score thanks, in part, to Rishabh Pant&#39;s aggressive half-century. Despite the magical moments provided by Dhoni, it was the collective effort and strategic execution by the Capitals that sealed the deal. DC&#39;s bowlers, with Ahmed leading the charge, effectively dismantled the opposing lineup, ensuring their strategy culminated in a well-deserved 20-run victory over CSK&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Ruturaj Gaikwad <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Honestly, I was pleased with our comeback after the initial overs. Considering their start at 60 for no loss, pulling them back to 190 felt like a solid effort. Throughout the game, the pitch seemed consistent, though Rachin appeared to struggle a bit with the spongy bounce. Our start wasn&#39;t ideal, and that gap became the critical difference. Initially, the target seemed achievable, but we soon faced significant seam movement and struggled to catch up, lacking those crucial big overs. Regarding Deepak, he&#39;s accustomed to bowling three overs upfront, although the last over in the powerplay turned out costly. After two wins, a setback in the third game isn&#39;t unexpected. Losing by 20 runs came down to just a few shots, and overall, our bowlers performed commendably.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Rishabh Pant, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Today, our bowlers were spot on. We&#39;ve taken our previous lessons to heart. Shaw has been putting in the effort for the last two weeks, and giving him the opportunity paid off today. Mukesh&#39;s role, especially at the death, will vary from game to game. For me, cricket has always been my life, and giving my all is non-negotiable. After not playing much for 1.5 years, it took some time to adjust, but my self-belief has never wavered. It&#39;s crucial to keep coming back, no matter what.&quot;<br />\n<br />\nKhaleel Ahmed (Player of the Match): &quot;My performance today is the fruit of relentless hard work at the domestic level. I&#39;ve focused on enhancing my swing, and it&#39;s gratifying to see the outcomes. There&#39;s a unique joy in watching batters struggle against my swing. Of course, making a comeback to the Indian team remains my ultimate aim. I appreciate all the blessings and support.&quot;</span></strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

However, their subsequent encounter saw them face a significant setback, as they endured a 63-run loss to the reigning champions, Chennai Super Kings (CSK), at Chepauk.</p>\n\n<p>Despite opting to field first in that match, GT allowed CSK to amass a daunting total of 206 runs. CSK&#39;s bowling unit then took centre stage, curtailing GT&#39;s chase to 143/8.</p>\n\n<p>SRH, meanwhile, has been the talk of the tournament following their explosive performance against MI, where they racked up the highest-ever IPL team total of 277 runs. The trio of Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, and Heinrich Klaasen were instrumental in this historic feat, scoring 62, 63, and an unbeaten 80 runs, respectively. Despite a valiant effort from the Hardik Pandya-led MI, SRH&#39;s bowling attack managed to hold them to 246, showcasing their team&#39;s depth and prowess.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>SUNRISERS &amp; TITANS IPL 2024 :</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> :&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">L&nbsp; &nbsp;</span> <span style=\"color:#16a085\">W</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> :&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:#16a085\">W</span>&nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">L</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Both the teams have won against the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD-TO-HEAD IN IPL:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl 2024 Notification Temp_1711876119.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Ravi Shashtri and Kevin Pietersen: <span style=\"color:#330000\">&quot;It&#39;s a warm afternoon here in Ahmedabad.

On the surface, this looks like a very good wicket. Looks like a batting track. It&#39;s an absolute road, it looks like a tremendous wicket. There&#39;s quite a nice breeze flowing across the ground, so that might help the players tremendously. It&#39;s going to get up to 38 or 40 degrees here.

I think they bowled well, just losing a couple of wickets, didn&rsquo;t have that one person who kicked on to get a fifty, that happens. Today it was, we thought the wicket was going to get a bit slow, but the off-cutters did grip, we had 8 bowling options in our side but still could not do it. I thought the wicket played the same in both innings. Had a fantastic couple of games with the bat, today we didn&rsquo;t quite click.

Two more to go and then we go on the road. Our bowlers were splendid in the middle overs. Both Rashid (Khan) and Noor (Ahmad) were great. Rashid is world-class. Mohit (Sharma) is such an experienced bowler. He comes in and bowls the slower bouncers. Executes his variations perfectly. All credit to him. In this heat, it&#39;s easier to bat early in day games. So, we wanted to make them hit to the bigger boundary off slower balls. We thought 160-170 would be a good score. Our bowlers restricted them. The players are clear with their respective roles. It was important for (David) Miller to get back in form. Thankfully, he came good. He&#39;s not injured. Just cramps.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mohit Sharma Player of the Match. &quot;The key is to deploy variations at just the right moment. You have to be a step ahead of the batters. Making the right field adjustments is also crucial. Regarding the dew, we&#39;ve been practicing with the wet ball to get used to it. It&#39;s really about learning from past errors. Our spinners came through when it mattered most.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Lucknow, despite a commendable effort, fell short against the Rajasthan Royals. KL Rahul found form with a fluent 58 off 44 balls, and Nicholas Pooran contributed a vigorous unbeaten 64, but their efforts were insufficient to secure a victory, ending up 20 runs behind. With such explosive talent in their lineup, expectations are high for them to make a significant impact as the tournament progresses.</p>\n\n<p>On the flip side, the Punjab Kings have experienced mixed fortunes with a win and a loss so far in the competition. Their most recent outing saw them falter against RCB, with Dinesh Karthik&#39;s finishing prowess proving too much to handle. While their batters have shown promise with solid starts, it&#39;s their performance at the death that raises concerns, particularly Harshal Patel&#39;s bowling in the crucial final overs. The team is keenly aware of this and is expected to strategize effectively to bolster their late-game bowling.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-to-Head in IPL:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl 2024 Notification Temp_1711807019.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nBC Lara and Matthew Hayden: &nbsp;<span style=\"color:#330000\">&quot;The square boundaries are at 61m and 68m respectively, down the ground is 76m.

I told my partners to use the short side and his pace. He bowled at Prabh&#39;s body and got him out. Told Jitesh to leave Mayank and take on the other bowlers but they bowled well too and then used the pressure against us. We need to analyse the game. We gotta take catches because dropping catches takes the momentum away and gets the energy down. We need to come up with better plans and more importantly, implement them is what we need to do.

The square is a little bit used, but the outfield looks superb. The dimensions of the ground aren&#39;t huge. We are the centre of the square - 61 metres (square) on either side and 75 metres straight. A high six-hitting ground. In the first game played here, we saw a number of seam bowlers taking pace off the ball and using the slower option. Maybe that&#39;s something faster bowlers may go to today. It looks interesting. It&#39;s still a good wicket and if the spinners keep landing the ball well it can get you a little more turn. We hope there&#39;ll be no dew factor&quot;.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (30)_1711720498.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000000\">TOSS:&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 2024_1711721075.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span><br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;has won the toss and have elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We are going to field first.

We thought it was a decent score knowing that it gets a little easier in the evening, there was a little bit of dew coming in too. Looking at the way we batted in the first innings it was tough due to the lack of pace. We could have tried one or two things differently but the way the Salt and Narine batted, put immense pressure on our bowlers. They hit strong cricket shots and pretty much took the game away.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; It was helpful to get some practice sessions here, we were in good shape from the previous game too. Personally Coming and hitting a few balls in the middle, it felt comfortable from within. The way Andre Russell came in and realised the wicket wasn&#39;t giving much assistance to the bowlers, made us resort to slower ones, analysing the conditions on the spot was pleasing to the eye. The communication was brilliant. When Narine comes in to open, he knows he has one job which is to clear the infield. Today we were contemplating whether to start with him or not but he did a brilliant job and took the game away from the opposition.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sunil Narine is the Player of the Match&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Sunil Narine: &quot; It&#39;s a nice milestone to reach 500 T20s.

The Capitals are looking to rebound from an initial setback, having faced a defeat in their opening match against Punjab Kings.&nbsp;Batting first, DC, led by Rishabh Pant, managed to set a decent target of 175 runs in their 20 overs. A collective effort from the top order and Abishek Porel&#39;s final burst proved crucial for them. But, on the back of Sam Curran&#39;s brilliant half-century, Shikhar Dhawan and his team overcame the target with four balls to spare.</p>\n\n<p>Contrastingly, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> kicked off their season on a high note, securing a victory against Lucknow Super Giants on March 24 in Jaipur. For the Royals, captain Sanju Samson was the key to getting them to a competitive total of 193/4. The right-handed batter smashed a blazing 82 off 52, while Riyan Parag also contributed with a 29-ball 43. Nicholas Pooran and skipper KL Rahul toiled for LSG, but an impressive bowling effort, especially from Sandeep Sharma, restricted them to 173/6. With their sights set on continuing their success streak, the Royals are gearing up for their second home game with anticipation and the determination to extend their winning momentum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">RISHABH PANT</span> VS <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">R ASHWIN</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">DAVID WARNER</span> VS <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">TRENT BOULT</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Vs <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Head To Head :</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> have squared off 27 times in the IPL, with Capitals claiming victory in 13 encounters, while Royals has edged ahead with 14 wins.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\nNIGHT GAMES OF IPL 2023 AT JAIPUR:&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />FIRST: 2<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND: 2<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 172</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nSimon Katich and Samuel Badree: &nbsp;&quot;It&#39;s a fresh track. 67m square boundaries on both sides and 76m down the ground.

Having both faced setbacks in their opening matches of the season, each team is eager to chart a course back to victory. For the Sunrisers, this match marks their inaugural home game of IPL 2024, presenting a perfect opportunity to clinch their first win in the comfort of their stadium, buoyed by the support of their fans.</p>\n\n<p>Under the leadership of Pat Cummins, SRH&#39;s journey in the 2024 edition commenced on a sombre note, succumbing to a heartbreakingly close four-run defeat against the two-time champions, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. Despite this initial stumble, the team is poised for a resurgence as they face off against Mumbai Indians in what promises to be a riveting encounter.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />, under Hardik Pandya&#39;s leadership, initiated their IPL 2024 campaign with a narrow defeat to Gujarat Titans (GT) by six runs at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Despite being in a promising position by the 15th over during the chase, MI couldn&#39;t capitalize towards the end, leaving them eager to move past this setback and seek victory in their upcoming matches. Notably, since IPL 2013, MI has historically found themselves on the back foot in season openers.</p>\n\n<p>In their opening game, Jasprit Bumrah delivered an exceptional performance, with figures of 4-0-14-3, playing a crucial role in containing GT to a manageable total. Rohit Sharma, the stalwart Mumbaikar, contributed a fiery 43 off 29 balls, keeping MI&#39;s chase on track before his dismissal turned the tide of the game. Looking ahead, MI is counting on the continued form of these key players to drive them towards their first win of the season and build the momentum they are known for.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Vs <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> Head To Head:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SRH and MI have encountered in 21 matches in the IPL.

Leg-side is 66 metres, off-side is 63 metres, 76 metres down the ground. Looks like a great batting wicket, this one&#39;s void of grass. The best time to bat is against the brand-new ball. As the ball loses shine, the bowlers who use variations and bowl slower ones will get a purchase from the wicket. Teams need to capitalize in the first 5-10 overs while batting. There&#39;s going to be something in it for the fast bowlers in the beginning, and something in it for the spinners throughout. Bowlers who hit the hard length will enjoy bowling here.

They bowled well too. It was tough out there, almost 500 runs were scored and the wicket was assisting the batters. we could have done a few things differently, but having said that, we have a young bowling attack and we will learn from this.

The ball was pinging around. Not until we bowled, it get a bit too close for comfort. They found a boundary whenever they needed it, but we finished it off well. Abhishek Sharma is impressive, in IPL you play with a lot of pressure but he plays with great freedom. When batting You never play for 270, but we wanted to be positive and be aggressive from the beginning and take the game on. It was a good wicket, so we have to suck it up knowing we would go for a few boundaries.

The message for the batters is simple - go out and express yourself. The plan was to attack, I enjoyed batting with Head, he&#39;s one of my favourite batters, and I admire him. He told me to go for it if it was in my zone. I&#39;m happy to be getting my chances, doesn&#39;t matter what position I&#39;m playing.

Both teams have won their respective openers, with CSK defeating their rival RCB, while GT overcame the five-time champions, Mumbai.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For CSK, Mustafizur Rahman delivered a fearsome spell in the first game, claiming four important wickets, including those of Kohli, Faf, Patidar, and Green, while Deepak Chahar accounted for the dangerous Maxwell. Rachin Ravindra had an impressive debut, going berserk against the opposition with a quickfire 37 off 15 balls, while his compatriot, Daryl Mitchell, also made a notable debut, scoring 22 off 18, including two sixes. The duo of Shivam Dube and Ravindra Jadeja provided a perfect finish to the game with a solid half-century partnership.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>For GT, Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill picked up where they left off, impressing the management with a flurry of runs, with the former scoring 45 and the latter adding an important 31. The pace department collectively secured 8 wickets, with all four bowlers&mdash;Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Spencer Johnson, and Azmatullah Omarzai&mdash;picking up two wickets each. The spin duo of Sai Kishore and Rashid Khan bowled economically in the middle overs, conceding only 47 runs in their eight overs and taking a wicket.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Both teams will look to carry the winning momentum going ahead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> vs <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /><strong> Head-to-Head:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In the five games battled, <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">GT</span> won three games while <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">CSK</span> won two.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/14_1711458728.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stats and Records at MA Chidambaram Stadium:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Pacers have picked as many as 506 wickets in the 77 matches played at this venue while spinners have picked 331 wickets in as many games. 46 of the games have been won by teams defending while 31 games have been won by teams chasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions:</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (3)_1711459596.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Hayden</strong>&nbsp;: &quot;It&#39;s a different track tonight.

The innings were marked by notable contributions from their lineup, particularly the left-handed duo Rachin Ravindra and Shivam Dube. Ravindra delivered a fiery 46 at a strike rate of 230, while Dube unleashed a barrage of hits, amassing 51 off just 23 balls. Tasked with a daunting target of 206, GT faced an uphill battle right from the onset, compounded by the early loss of their captain, Shubman Gill, during the powerplay. Deepak Chahar&#39;s initial breakthroughs, removing both openers, laid the groundwork for CSK&#39;s dominance in the subsequent overs. GT struggled to find their rhythm, with CSK&#39;s bowlers efficiently dismantling their batting lineup and ensuring wickets fell consistently. Ultimately, GT could not surmount the challenge, falling short by 63 runs, as CSK&#39;s fortress remained unbreached.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shubman Gill, GT Skipper:</span> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;They outplayed us in the second innings and their execution was spot on. We backed ourselves to get a decent score in the powerplay and once we didn&rsquo;t, we were always behind the 8th ball. On this wicket, we were expecting to chase 190-200. I think it&rsquo;s a great learning for the bowlers. I think it&rsquo;s better to have this kind of game early on in the tournament rather than in the latter stage. A lot of new learnings for me and new experiences. It&rsquo;s exciting to captain a team like <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />, we&rsquo;ve made it to the finals in the last couple of years so very exciting to be leading such a side.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Ruturaj Gaikwad, CSK Skipper: </span>&quot; &nbsp;<span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Definitely today&#39;s game was perfect in all three departments batting, bowling and fielding, and against a team like Gujarat we needed to come up with a performance like this. In Chennai we are not sure how the wicket will be, we need to do well irrespective of batting or bowling first. Here if we have wickets in hand at the end it helps. Personally felt, that Rachin batted brilliantly in the powerplay and took the game away. From there we were always ahead. Shivam Dube is high on confidence, the management and Mahi bhai worked with him, and his confidence is very high. He knows his roles very well. Definitely he is a big plus for us. Personally very happy with fielding as well&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Shivam Dube is Player of the Match</span></strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">Shivam Dube: &quot; This franchise is different from all others.

In stark contrast, the Punjab Kings stride into the fray buoyed by an assertive victory, showcasing their formidable form early in the tournament.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>In their opening match, RCB&rsquo;s promising start was swiftly undone by a tactical masterclass from &#39;Fizz&#39;, whose devastating spell left RCB floundering at a precarious 78/5 by the 12th over. Despite the dire straits, Dinesh Karthik and Anuj Rawat valiantly spearheaded a counter-attack, elevating their team to a respectable 173/6. Their efforts painted a picture of resilience, yet the inability of RCB&#39;s bowlers to defend this total, resulting in a 6-wicket loss, underscored a pressing need for strategic recalibrations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> have carved a narrative of confidence and aggression right from the outset. With a blend of disciplined bowling led by Arshdeep Singh and Harshal Patel, each clinching two wickets, and dynamic batting performances from Sam Curran and Liam Livingstone, they notched up a convincing victory against the Delhi Capitals.

This has been a high-scoring ground because of the ground dimensions and the centre pitch is being used; 60 meters on either side and straight down the ground is 70 meters. It certainly does look like a high-scoring Chinnaswamy pitch. The pitch is rock hard, there&#39;s a bit of grass on it and what we know about last year&#39;s IPL is the average first innings score is 196. The ball is going to fly everywhere. The trend in this IPL so far has been the home team winning. Can the RCB get off the mark tonight in front of their adoring fans? There are a few cracks but they look superficial and it also looks patchy with patches of grass. Maybe a little bit two-paced because it is dry where there are cracks but under lights you expect the ball to come on to the bat&quot;.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (18)_1711375005.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/MicrosoftTeams-image - 2024-03-25T193843_1711375756.png\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">has won the toss and have elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; first</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Faf du Plesis, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;We are going to have a bowl.

Despite promising starts from the PBKS lineup, a substantial innings eluded them. Yash Dayal&#39;s formidable powerplay overs, coupled with Siraj&#39;s adept run rate management, saw the duo surrender a mere 49 runs across their combined 8 overs while claiming three vital wickets. Shashank Singh&#39;s spirited charge towards the end propelled PBKS to a commendable 176.</p>\n\n<p>RCB&#39;s chase witnessed early setbacks, losing two wickets early on, yet Kohli, true to his moniker &#39;King Kohli,&#39; kept the scoreboard ticking, crafting a masterful 77 off 49 balls. However, his dismissal by Harshal Patel set the stage for a thrilling climax, with RCB needing 47 off the final 24 balls. It was then that DK stepped up, epitomizing the adage &quot;cometh the hour, cometh the man,&quot; alongside Mahipal Lomror, who unleashed a flurry of shots. Lomror&#39;s rapid 17 off 8 and DK&#39;s explosive 28 at an astounding strike rate of 280 ushered RCB to victory with four balls to spare, illustrating the dynamic, unpredictable nature of cricket where heroes emerge in the face of adversity.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Shikhar Dhawan, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;It was a decent game, we came back and again lost it. We scored 10-15 runs less, in the powerplay as I played a bit slow. Those 10-15 runs cost us and the dropped catch did not help either. &nbsp;Virat scored 70-odd runs after we dropped a catch of a class player like him, we paid the price. If we had taken that catch, the momentum would have come from the second ball. But we lost the momentum over there and then we paid the price for that.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, RCB Skipper: Talking about the calmness &quot;On the outside, not as much on the inside. Early in the competition you want to make sure you get over the line. Felt we were in the position to do that sooner. With the new rule, we knew we had Mahipal coming in - has a lot of power. Now with the extra batter, you feel like even 14-15 rpo is gettable. Pleased DK.

But when you look back it&#39;s the memories you create. The love, appreciation and backing I&#39;ve received has been amazing. I try to give the team a blazing start, but if wickets fall you have to assess. Wasn&#39;t the usual flat pitch. Disappointed I couldn&#39;t finish the game. Was in the slot but sliced it to a deep point. They know I play the cover drive well, so they&#39;re not going to allow me to hit gaps. You have to come up with a game plan here and there. I know my name is now attached to just promoting the game in different parts of the world when it comes to T20 cricket. I&#39;ve still got it I guess.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

We&#39;ve had excellent practice matches and sessions, and everyone&#39;s looking sharp.

Gujarat Titans&#39; opening duo, Wriddhiman Saha and Shubman Gill, got off to a swift start.&nbsp;Gill contributed 31 from 22 deliveries, B Sai Sudharsan compiled 45 from 39, and Azmatullah Omarzai&#39;s brief appearance yielded 17 runs off 11 balls. Bumrah&#39;s tight bowling was the highlight, ending the figures of 4-0-14-3. Rahul Tewatia&#39;s quick 22 off 15 helped set GT&#39;s score at 168/6 by the end of their innings. Omarzai early on rattled MI with the dismissal of Ishan Kishan for a duck and later Naman Dhir, who had started aggressively with 20 runs from 10 balls. Rohit Sharma and Dewald Brevis stitched together a promising 77-run partnership, seemingly steering Mumbai towards a comfortable chase during the mid-overs. However, Sai Kishore, managed to dismiss Rohit for 43 off 29 balls, signaling a shift in momentum. As the match progressed, GT&#39;s bowlers excellently exploited the conditions, elevating the required run rate and putting pressure on the Mumbai lineup, which faltered despite having power hitters like Tim David and Pandya. Mohit Sharma&#39;s spell of 4-0-32-2 and Spencer Johnson&#39;s crucial 19th over, where he claimed two vital wickets, underscored a remarkable turnaround by the Titans just as MI appeared in control of their chase. Needing 19 runs off the last over, Pandya&#39;s initial boundaries brought hope, narrowing it down to 9 required from 4 balls. However, Yadav&#39;s experience prevailed, ensuring a victorious start for Gill&#39;s captaincy tenure against his predecessor.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We were confident in our ability to chase down the 42 runs, yet, unfortunately, today wasn&#39;t our day as we lost momentum. Returning here is always a pleasure, the stadium offers a vibrant atmosphere, and with the stands packed, the crowd certainly witnessed an exciting match. We still have 13 matches to go.&quot;&nbsp;</span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000066\">Shubman Gill,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper, &quot;Absolutely, the team did exceptionally well to keep their composure despite the dew setting in. There was significant dew, but even then, Rashid and Sai bowled magnificently to keep us in contention. Mohit Sharma has been a phenomenal asset since joining us, continuing his stellar performance from last season. Our strategy was all about ramping up the pressure on the opposition.The fans have been incredible, turning up in full force, day or night, to cheer us on. Ideally, a total of 170 would have been more comforting, yet we fell short by 10 runs. Such is the nature of cricket. There were moments they seemed to be getting ahead, but striking the ball wasn&rsquo;t straightforward here.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000066\">Sai Sudharsan is the Player of the Match:</span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#000066\">Sai Sudharsan: &quot;I feel it was slightly difficult in both the first and second innings. Because of the dew, they were able to play a few shots, but we pulled off a great game. I am just taking it as an extra opportunity to try and win a game for my team. After a few balls, I felt this is that kind of a wicket where you can go hard everywhere and wanted to build on the momentum. Too many great contributions in the second innings. As a batter, I found it tough when they took the pace off and our bowlers executed really well today&quot;</span></p>\n",

Despite these challenges, their batsmen lit up the powerplays, marking themselves as the most aggressive starters, a stark contrast to LSG&#39;s more measured approach, which ranked them among the slowest. Looking ahead to IPL 2024, both Rajasthan Royals and Lucknow Super Giants maintain their squad cores without major overhauls. Royals&#39; strategy revolves around the formidable Jos Buttler, while LSG will lean on KL Rahul&#39;s prowess, with Devdutt Padikkal potentially leading their charge as the opener. The spin duo of Ravi Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal for Rajasthan, and Naveen-ul-Haq with Ravi Bishnoi for Lucknow, are set to headline their respective bowling attacks.

Riyan Parag then took charge, contributing a valuable 43 to the innings. The partnership between Samson and Parag laid the foundation for RR&#39;s substantial total. Samson&#39;s innings, coupled with Dhruv Jurel&#39;s quickfire cameo, propelled RR to 193/4. On the LSG front, Naveen-ul-Haq emerged as the lead bowler, claiming two crucial wickets. LSG initially lost 3 wickets in the powerplay and was put on the backfoot. KL held one end and Hooda provided the acceleration! As the chase intensified, LSG found themselves in a crunch situation, needing 49 runs off the final 24 deliveries. It was Sharma&#39;s crucial over, culminating in Rahul&#39;s wicket, that tipped the scales. Despite Rahul&#39;s patient 58 and Pooran&#39;s more aggressive 64* off 41, their efforts fell short. Initially, RR seemed to lose grip after reducing LSG to a precarious position, but Sharma, with his 1 for 22 in three overs, was precisely what RR needed. Their tight bowling restricted LSG, sealing a pivotal win for the home side.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0066\"><strong>Sanju Samson, RR Skipper and Player of the Match:</strong></span> <span style=\"color:#ff0066\">&quot;Always great to spend time in the middle and it becomes more special when you win the game. This time I&#39;ve been given a different kind of role with a new combination we have. I&#39;ve been playing IPL for 10 years and there has to be some experience coming in. I feel I need to spend more time and understand the conditions. Playing ODIs also helped me. It&#39;s all about understanding your strengths and weaknesses. I should give this trophy to him Sandeep. He has that in his eyes, in his body language that you can trust that guy.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, LSG Skipper:</strong>&nbsp;&quot;The target wasn&#39;t a lot but we made a few mistakes. Good to see Mohsin back bowling well. Naveen has been crucial for us. We need to learn from our mistakes and find ways to win games. Langer has bought a lot of calmness to the group. We enjoy having him around.&quot;</span></p>\n",

Neither team managed to secure a spot in the playoffs in the previous season.&nbsp;<br />\nThis year, both teams will be steered by new captains, bringing a fresh perspective to the field. Shreyas Iyer makes his much-anticipated return to KKR, ready to lead the team with renewed vigour after a year&#39;s absence. Meanwhile, Pat Cummins, known for his cool and composed demeanor, takes the helm of SRH following a series of global cricketing successes. The inclusion of Travis Head and Wanindu Hasaranga, alongside the trade for Shahbaz Ahmed, positions SRH as one of the most well-rounded teams in the competition. With Marco Jansen and Aiden Markram also key figures, SRH is looking forward to initiating their campaign on a triumphant note.<br />\nOn the other side, KKR is eager to make a strong start under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer, who is back to infuse dynamism and strategic prowess into the team. The acquisition of Mitchell Starc represents a significant investment, adding a layer of rich experience to the squad. The team also welcomed Dushmantha Chameera as a replacement for the injured Atkinson, and Phill Salt steps in for Jason Roy, who opted out of the IPL to manage his workload. With such strategic changes, KKR aims to embark on this tournament with high spirits and a winning mindset.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>KKR vs SRH Head-to-Head&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the 25 games contested between the two, <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>KKR has won 16 games</strong></span> while <strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">SRH has managed to win the rest of the nine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl 2024 Notification Temp_1711198258.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Stats at Eden Garden:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Pacers have picked 503 wickets at this venue while the spinners have managed to pick 378 wickets. <strong>The average score batting first here is 160.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (7)_1711198602.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/GJXDSA5W8AESks6_1711204002.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /><br />\n<span style=\"color:#d35400\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;has won the toss and have elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nPat Cummins <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: We&#39;ve decided to bowl first; the pitch looks great.

In a match where momentum swung wildly, KKR&#39;s 208/7, fueled by Andre Russell&#39;s devastating 64 off 25 and Phil Salt&#39;s brisk fifty, proved just enough.The match kicked off with KKR batting first; Phil Salt&rsquo;s aggressive 54 set the tone, despite early wickets tumbling. Ramandeep Singh&rsquo;s quickfire 35 and Russell&rsquo;s late blitz propelled KKR past the 200-mark, a total that looked distant midway. T Natarajan was the pick of the bowlers for SRH, snagging three key wickets.SRH&rsquo;s chase ignited with Mayank Agarwal and Abhishek Sharma putting up a swift 60-run opening stand. However, KKR&#39;s spinners, led by Sunil Narine, tightened the screws in the middle overs, making the chase increasingly arduous. Klaasen&#39;s late surge, scoring a fiery 63 in 29, brought SRH tantalizingly close, but Rana&#39;s cool final over, defending 13 runs, clinched the thriller for KKR.This electrifying clash wasn&#39;t just a game; it was a testament to KKR&#39;s resilience and strategic brilliance, echoing the golden era of 2014 with Gambhir&#39;s spirit felt in the dugout and Russell and Narine turning back the clock with their match-winning performances. As KKR embarks on their campaign with a nail-biting victory, the echoes of Eden Gardens&#39; roars remind us of the magic of cricket and the fine margins that define it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;It was a nail-biter, truly a fantastic display of cricket. Sadly, it didn&rsquo;t swing in our favor. I&rsquo;m largely pleased with our bowling effort through the game. Andre Russell, in the closing stages, did what he&rsquo;s known for, proving to be a formidable challenge to contain. On the whole, I believe we managed quite well. Despite the planning and execution, facing someone like Dre Russ is always a tough call. He played some exceptional shots, though there were a few deliveries we possibly could have executed differently. Bowling to a powerhouse like him in the final overs is arguably the most challenging task in cricket. It can go either way, but it was remarkable how Klaas (Klaasen) and Shahbaz brought us back into contention and nearly across the line. It was unexpected yet impressive to get that close. Competing against such a strong team, especially at their home ground, is commendable. There&#39;s a lot from this game that&rsquo;s encouraging, alongside standout performances, but also a few aspects we need to tweak. I&rsquo;m content with how the coin toss turned out.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Heading into the 17th over, my stomach was in knots, sensing the game could swing any way in the final moments. With 13 runs needed and a less experienced bowler at the helm, the pressure was palpable. Yet, my belief in him was unwavering. I reassured him, urging him to have faith in his abilities, emphasizing that the outcome was secondary. He seemed anxious, but I made it a point to look him straight in the eyes and remind him, &#39;this is your moment, buddy.&#39; Encouraging him to trust in his skills, regardless of the game&#39;s direction. Their team&#39;s experience is formidable. Watching Andre excel with both bat and ball, along with Sunny&#39;s exceptional performance with the ball, was heartening. Having such talent in the team not only motivates but also brings a wealth of knowledge. Kicking off with a victory always boosts morale. Nevertheless, this match has been a learning curve, offering insights we&#39;re keen to carry forward. Fielding, in particular, is one aspect we&#39;re looking to bolster.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Andre Russell | Player of the Match: Honestly, it&#39;s not often that I pay attention, but occasionally, I&#39;ll notice highlights on my Instagram and realize just how well I&#39;ve been hitting the ball. It&#39;s a nice reminder that things are going well. I&#39;ve had to adapt to whatever&#39;s thrown my way, especially in the past couple of years, as bowlers craft specific plans against me. Despite that, I&#39;ve managed to score runs, fully aware that every opponent has a strategy for me. Reflecting on my time with KKR, I started off on the sidelines, but I always aimed to contribute meaningfully. This team holds a special place in my heart, and what I achieved tonight is a testament to the significance of wearing this jersey. I&#39;m hopeful to continue delivering performances like this. Speaking of Harshit Rana, his actions speak volumes about his character. He was adamant about bowling the final over, took the responsibility upon himself, and remarkably bounced back after the first delivery was hit for a six.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

Both teams had a dismal outing last season, having been placed at 8th and 9th in the table and would look to erase those memories this season.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rishabh Pant, after missing out on the entire season last time, is all set to join their team to lead from the front this season. The presence of Pant will set the balance of Delhi in the batting department, while they have invested a huge price for the young sensation, Kumar Kushagra, who showed promise in the domestic circuits. Australian Captain Mitchell Marsh and Axar Patel are their key all-rounders, while Anrich Nortje will spearhead their pace bowling attack, and David Warner will be the key prospect with the bat, given the huge amount of experience he has got. The new-look Delhi will be keen to start their campaign on a high.Punjab Kings, on the other hand, led by Shikhar Dhawan, will be finding their combinations right this season. The trio of Rabada, Sam Curran, and Arshdeep Singh form the base of their bowling attack, while the addition of Harshal Patel has strengthened their bowling unit, providing a variety of options in the death. In the batting department, they have invested a good price in Rilee Rossouw, who will combine with Dhawan and Livingstone, forming a strong batting core. Jonny Bairstow is set to return to the squad to provide depth in the batting, along with the finisher, Jitesh Sharma. Punjab has ticked all the boxes this season and will hope their combinations work well to go deep in the tournament.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> vs <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Head-to-Head in IPL:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Both the teams have met on 32 occasions, with the results being even-steven, both winning 16 matches each and losing as many games.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPl 2024 Notification Temp_1711187626.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones to Watch out for:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>3 &ndash;David Warner (647) needs three fours to complete 650 fours in IPL.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2 &ndash;Shikhar Dhawan (148) needs two sixes to complete 150 sixes in IPL.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>3 &ndash;Liam Livingstone (397) needs three fours to complete 400 fours in T20s.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>4 &ndash;Shikhar Dhawan (96) needs four fours to complete 100 fours for PBKS in IPL.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>6 &ndash;Anrich Nortje (144) needs six wickets to complete 150 wickets in T20s.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT: &nbsp;&quot;It is 75 metres straight down the ground at one end and 64 metres at the other end.

The match was marked by Delhi&#39;s missed opportunities in the field, which proved costly. Punjab&#39;s chase of 175 started strong with Dhawan and Bairstow but stumbled briefly. Sam Curran, batting at No. 4, alongside Prabhsimran Singh, kept the scoreboard ticking, capitalizing on DC&#39;s fielding lapses. Curran&#39;s crucial 63 set the stage, despite Khaleel Ahmed&#39;s late attempt to swing the match in DC&#39;s favor with two 19th-over wickets.Earlier, DC had set a target of 174, boosted by a 25-run onslaught in the last over. Despite getting starts, DC&#39;s batters, including Warner and Marsh, failed to convert. Shai Hope&#39;s 33 was the top score, with a cameo from Abishek Porel adding to their total.

Abishek&#39;s performance was a highlight, but being a bowler down made it tough. Despite the nerves, I felt our score was competitive, but Ishant&#39;s absence due to injury put us at a disadvantage. We&#39;re not looking for excuses, but playing short-handed on this pitch was a challenge.

Being back on the field and gearing up for this tournament has been my focus since the last IPL ended. I won&#39;t lie, stepping into this competitive arena again had me a bit nervous. After the explosive last over, I chose not to engage with anyone immediately since I was about to bat, and I believe in giving the bowlers their space to process their emotions. We&#39;ve got time tomorrow to regroup, discuss, and enhance our game for the better.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nSam Curran (Player of the Match): &quot;Feeling great about our opening win and my performance. The key was to stay until the end. Cricket&#39;s about taking calculated risks at the right moments. Having a bit of luck on your side definitely helps.

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>The unfolding IPL saga captures the anticipation as the defending Champions, Chennai Super Kings, gear up to begin their title defence by hosting their rivals, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, in the TATA IPL 2024&#39;s curtain-raiser on 22nd March 2024 at the famed MA Chidambaram Stadium.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Last season, CSK had a remarkable run, defeating the then-defending champions, Gujarat Titans, both in Qualifier-1 and the finals. However, this season, they&#39;ll be without key players Devon Conway and Matheesha Pathirana, who were instrumental in their success, as well as Ambati Rayudu, who will be missed following his retirement. Despite these absences, CSK has refreshed its squad with promising talents such as Sameer Rizvi and Aravelley Avanish, who have shown remarkable performance in local circuits recently. The inclusion of potent players like Daryl Mitchell and Rachin Ravindra adds a dynamic edge to the team, making CSK a well-balanced mix of experience and youthful exuberance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Royal Challengers Bengaluru is looking to bounce back from a rather ordinary season last year, finishing in sixth place with an equal number of wins and losses. Their performance heavily relied on the batting prowess of Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, and Glenn Maxwell, while their bowling lineup struggled to make an impact. To revamp their bowling attack, RCB released Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, and Josh Hazlewood, bringing in Alzarri Joseph, Lockie Ferguson, and Yash Dayal. All eyes will be on Virat Kohli, whose performance is eagerly anticipated, especially with the World Cup considerations on the horizon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">CSK</span> vs <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">RCB </span>Head-to-Head in IPL:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>In as many as <strong>31 games</strong> played between the two, <strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> has dominated the contest with 20 wins</span></strong> while <span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> has managed to win on 10 occasions</strong></span>.

Looks a good pitch, conditions here are always a bat first wicket. First time back here, great to see the Chennai fans again but I&#39;m here with RCB and hopefully we can turn over a very good CSK team. Prep has been good, we need to turn up now. Andy Flower is a seasoned campaigner, brings that experience. Our bowling resources fit well. Got more backup. Hopefully, injuires don&#39;t concern us much. Alzarri Joseph comes in tonight, got a few spinners in the middle. And since we are batting first, we&#39;ll see how it goes.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; Feel priviledged to be in the position. But I want to try and be in my shoes, not fill MSD&#39;s shoes. I got to know last week, but Mahi bhai hinted at it last year. Everyone is experienced here, sadly we are missing Conway and Pathirana. We&#39;ve got Rachin and Mitchell coming in though this year so they should fit in well. Four overseas - Mitchell, Rachin, Fizz and Theekshana. The mystery spinner Sameer Rizvi is making his debut as well.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Although it may not have been the suspenseful drama that some had anticipated, this major competition is off to a great start. RCB performed admirably earlier, posting 173 after struggling at 78/5. Courtesy of Mustafizur Rahman who bagged 4 wickets on his CSK Debut. Although it was a respectable score and RCB would have realized that they needed to bowl well because the surface became slightly more favorable for batting under lights. The opening pair for CSK were off to a flying start, with Rachin making a memorable debut with a 15-ball 37. RCB somewhat recovered during the middle overs. But the onslaught from Dube and Jadeja gave no chance to RCB bowlers to stage a comeback during the death overs.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Mustafizur Rahman is Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plesis, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; Always when you play, you get a bit of dip after the powerplay. Chennai is a very good team in the middle overs, they squeeze you with their spinners. Maybe we were about 15-20 runs short, the pitch wasn&rsquo;t as bad as we played in the first 10 overs. They were always ahead in the chase, we tried to squeeze and get a couple of wickets, but in the end, we didn&rsquo;t have enough runs on the board. On this pitch, it is always better to bat first. Last year, the record leans towards teams that batted first. The ball started to grip a bit with our spinners. Good for DK to set up his season, especially for someone who hasn&rsquo;t played a lot of cricket. Anuj Rawat has shown some great promise for us, he showed great composure for a young guy and great power through the backend.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; Total control I would say, right from the start apart from two-three overs in the middle over phase. Would&rsquo;ve loved 10-15 runs less but I think they played well towards the end to get to that score. I feel that was a big turning point to get Maxwell and Faf out. We got three quick wickets and it helped us control the next overs, that was the real turning point. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed it captaincy, but never felt it as an additional pressure. Role clarity helps. Couple of things to work on, everyone batted well but I think if someone from the top 3 batted till the 15th over it would&rsquo;ve been even easier.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
