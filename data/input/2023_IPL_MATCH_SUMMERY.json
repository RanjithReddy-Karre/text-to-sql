The home team is heading into this game after a comprehensive win against the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> in qualifier 2 whereas Chennai qualified for the finals after going past&nbsp; GT in a &nbsp;convincing manner in qualifier 1. The two sides having shown balance in all their departments have rightfully earned the opportunity to compete for the gold. MSD who is playing his 250th IPL game would be looking to win his 5th Title while his prodigy Hardik Pandya would look to defend his title on home soil. If he does so he will become the third captain in the history of the league to do so. Looking at Top performers from both sides, Shubman Gill holds the Orange cap<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/orange-cap.png\" style=\"height:24px; width:24px\" title=\"\" /> while Mohammad Shami<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/purple-cap.png\" style=\"height:24px; width:24px\" title=\"\" />, Rashid Khan, and Mohit Sharma top the list of highest wicket-takers this season. Looking at CSK, Devon Conway and Ruturaj Gaikwad have been doing the bulk of the scoring while Tushar Deshpande has been amongst the wickets.&nbsp; Can CSK beat GT and equal Mumbai Indians as the team with the most IPL trophies or will &nbsp;Hardik Pandya become the third skipper to lift the cup in two successive years?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>What was supposed to be an exciting day of cricket yesterday turned out to be a pretty damp day with heavy rains continuing for several hours eventually, there wasn&#39;t a ball bowled and the match between the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> was <strong><span style=\"color:#cc0033\">rescheduled to the reserve day</span></strong>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We are live from the Narendra Modi Stadium for IPL 2023 finale to be conducted on a <strong><span style=\"color:#cc0033\">reserve day</span></strong>.

The dimensions are as follows: 66-meter square boundaries and 74 meters downtown. It is a bit cooler than yesterday. I think that&#39;s going to help the ball swing around a bit. Not much has changed since yesterday. If anything, remember last night we had those grass clippings that were rolled in. Maybe they&#39;ve been removed a little bit which could bring in the slow-pace bowlers, especially on a good length where guys like Mohit hit it hard, and take the pace off. We have got quality spinners in both sides. Looks like 180 can be a par score here. Whatever happens though, you have to have a bat first, especially CSK&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Venue Stats (8)_1685368916.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT:</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">SHUBMAN GILL</span> VS <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">DEEPAK CHAHAR</span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">SHIVAM DUBE</span> VS <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">RASHID KHAN</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>TOSS:<br />\nCSK WINS THE TOSS AND ELECT TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/TOssss_1685369048.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">MS DHONI, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;We will want to bowl first with the rain forecast being around. Yesterday we were in the dressing room. As a cricketer, you always want to play. It was the crowd that suffered the most. Hopefully, we can entertain them.

Shubman Gill&#39;s 39 from 20 and Wriddhiman Saha&#39;s 54 at a strike rate of 138 set the tone for <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> to post a huge total. The impetus came from Sai Sudharsan who played his best T20 knock scoring 96 at a strike rate of 204 in an all-important final. GT put up a mammoth target of 215 which was never going to be an easy chase, especially in a finale. Rain playing spoil sport for a while resulted in the target being revised to 171 from 15 overs. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> opening pair of Devon Conway &amp; Ruturaj Gaikwad once again got the team off to a solid start setting the tone for the run chase. Conway scored 47 which included 4 boundaries and 2 sixes. Just when it looked easy for CSK, Noor Ahmed picking up 2 wickets in the 7th Over tilted the momentum in the home team&#39;s favor. But Shivam Dube was going goof from one end while some vital cameos from Rahane and Rayudu brought the chase back on track. It was left to Ravindra Jadeja when 10 runs were needed from the last 2 balls. The champion All-rounder held his nerves and struck A six off the second-last delivery and a boundary off the last to finish things off in style. CSK win their fifth IPL title under Mahendra Singh Dhoni!&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Devon Conway is Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Devon Conway : &quot;It was a long time to wait, I was very nervous but Ruturaj and myself plotted how we will go about it.

We play with a lot of heart, really proud of the way we kept fighting. We have a motto - we win together, we lose together. I&#39;m not going to make excuses, CSK played the better cricket. We batted really well, special mention to Sai Sudarshan, not easy to play that well at this level. We have been backing the boys and trying to make sure we get the best out of them. But their success is their success. The way they have put their hand up and delivered - Mohit, Rashid, Shami everyone. &nbsp;I&#39;m very happy for him, destiny had this written. If I had to lose, I&#39;d rather lose to him. Good things happen to good people, and he&#39;s been one of the best people I know. God has been kind, and God has been kind to me as well but today was his night&quot;.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">MS Dhoni, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />Skipper</span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">: </span><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">&quot;If you ask me&nbsp;for an answer. This is the best time to announce my retirement. But the amount of love I have received all over. The easy thing would be to walk away from here, but the harder thing would be working hard for 9 months and trying to play another IPL. It would be a gift from me, and won&#39;t be easy on the body. You do get emotional, the first game at CSK everyone was chanting my name. My eyes were full of water, I needed to take some time off in the dugout. I realized I need to enjoy this. I think they love me for what I am, they love that I am so grounded, I don&#39;t try to portray something I&#39;m not. Just keep it simple. Every trophy is special, but what is special about IPL is every crunch game you need to be ready. There were lapses today, the bowling department didn&#39;t work, but it was the batting department that took the pressure off them today. I do get frustrated, it is human but I try to step into their shoes, every individual deals with pressure differently. Ajinkya and a few others are experienced, so you don&#39;t worry. If anyone is confused, then can always ask. The special thing about Rayudu is he will always give his 100% when he is on his field. But with him in the team, I will never win the Fairplay award. I&#39;ve been playing with him for a long time, since the India A tours. He&#39;s a player who can play spin and pace equally well. It is something really special. I felt he would do something really special today&quot;,</span></p>\n",

It is 74m downtown and has some reasonable side pockets as well. There have been plenty of runs scored on pitch No. 7 - 204, 207 &amp; 227 batting first in the three games played. The wicket looks very patchy. Earlier in the season there was a lot more grass cover on it. Right now it looks like just rolled in grass which kind of gives the illusion that it is not too bad. Some quality spinners in both games and some upfront bowlers in the powerplay as well. This venue is the top 5 in the list of fours and sixes, but I am not convinced we will get those big numbers tonight. I think it is a 180 wicket at best.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Venue Stats (7)_1685111998.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">SHUBMAN GILL</span> VS <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">AKASH MADHWAL</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">SURYAKUMAR YADAV</span> VS <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">RASHID KHAN&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\nMI WINS THE TOSS AND ELECT TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/TOssss_1685111947.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />Skipper</span>: &quot;<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">We are gonna chase.

After being asked to bat first GT posted a mammoth total of 234 runs Courtesy of Shubhman Gill&#39;s blistering knock of 129 runs from just 60 balls. This was Gill&#39;s third ton of the season. Sai Sudharsan being involved in 138 run stand did well to compliment Gill from the other end. Hardik Pandya&#39;s cameo of 28 from 13 balls helped GT reach a total of 234. In reply, MI in the absence of Ishan Kishan started poorly losing their top order within the powerplay. Tilak Varma smashing 43 from 14 kept MI&#39;s scoring rate at par with the target. Suryakumar Yadav once again showed his class by being able to deliver under pressure. Sky amassed 61 from just 38 but fell short of support from the other end. Rashid Khan was the bowler that got the prize wicket of Tilak Varmav while Mohit Sharma introduced at the death accounted for Yadav&#39;s dismissal and ran through the MI lower order in no time. MI succumbing to the pressure fell short by 62 runs in the end. &nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;It was a great total, Shubman batted really well. The wicket was really good. They got 25 extra, and with the batting we had we were quite positive when we went in. Couldn&#39;t stitch enough partnerships. Green and Surya batted well but we lost our way. We spoke about giving it a good crack, we lost a couple of wickets in the powerplay and did not get the momentum when chasing a target like that. We have been talking about adapting to different conditions and different situations. I won&#39;t look into that, we did not play well to win the game. Playing this game and qualifying as 3rd gives us a lot of confidence, our batting has been the biggest positive, some of the younger players especially and take it to next season and see what you can do. Got to give credit to Shubman, he is in great form and I hope he continues that. Gujarat played well.

They keep practicing, and that reflects. I think the clarity and confidence that Shubman Gill is carrying is amazing. Today his innings were one of the finest, he never looked rushed. It felt like someone was throwing balls and he was hitting. Shubhman will be a superstar in International and franchise cricket. I do have conversations with him, I try that people to feed off my energy. Everyone takes responsibility for themselves and performs at their best. We have to play good cricket and put in 100% effort. Knockouts could go either way, but I am very excited for the final.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shubman Gill is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shubman Gill:&nbsp; &quot;For me, it is playing ball to ball and over to over. The over when I hit three sixes gave me the momentum to go for big runs. That&#39;s when I realized it could be my day. It was a good surface to bat on as well. Not a conscious decision, you keep inventing as a batter but for me, the belief is more important. I am coming off a good international season as well. Had a good season last time as well. When I start well, I feel confident that I can score well. Expectations are something that follows you outside the ropes, but once you step on the field it is all about trying how to contribute to the team. I think this was probably my best innings so far in the Indian Premier League.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The shot which I played was not on. The ball was coming nicely onto the bat but we just needed to have batted better. We didn&#39;t play good cricket after the strategic timeout. Quinton de Kock is a quality batter, but Kyle Mayers has a better record here, so we went ahead with him. MI batters batted really well against the fast bowlers, so I thought of starting with spinners against them.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;This is what we have done over the years. People don&#39;t expect us to do what we have done, but we managed to. Akash Madhwal was part of the team last year as a support bowler, and once Jofra Archer was gone and I knew he had the skills and the character to do the job for us. Over the years we have seen many guys coming in from Mumbai Indians and playing for the national team. It is important to make the youngsters feel special and make them feel part of the team, my job is to just make them comfortable in the middle. They are very clear in their roles about what they need to do for the team and that&#39;s what you want. As a team, we enjoy fielding. Good to see everyone contributing on the field. Coming to Chennai, we knew the whole team needs to come to the party. At Wankhede, you need one or two brilliant performances, but here it is a different ball game.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>Akash Madhwal is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000ff\"><strong>Akash Madhwal: &quot;I have put in a lot of hard work and waiting for my chance. I have done engineering but cricket has always been my passion. I have been waiting for this opportunity since 2018. When we practice the management gives us a target which we try to execute our best. I am happy with the role that the team has given me and glad that it is coming off well. I want to do well in the next matches too to take the team all the way. Out of all the wickets, Pooran&#39;s was my favorite. Would love to keep playing in a similar fashion for my team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The Titans are heading into this game after a close finish against the Royal Challengers whereas the Super Kings are coming into this game on the back of a win against the Capitals. The table toppers Titans have won &nbsp;10 out of 14 matches while CSK finished second on the points table having won eight out of their 14. Gujarat has an upper hand in terms of the head-to-head record having clinched all three encounters against the Yellow Army. The fact that Hardik Pandya and Co. have not competed at Chepauk makes this an interesting contest. The Winners of this match directly qualify to the finals whereas the losers get another opportunity to compete in the qualifier 2.

There are some patches that will offer plenty of quality spinners on both sides. The surface is on the drier side and is expected to slow down as the match progresses. 170 can prove to be a winning total.

While batting first it was once again the opening pair of CSK that did the maximum damage. A partnership of 87 set the tone for the middle order on a tricky track which assisted the slow bowlers. As the game progressed the pitch slowed down and it proved to be tough for Gujarat batters. A target of 173 seemed even bigger with CSK spinners maintaining tight lines. Ravindra Jadeja was the pick of the lot with figures of 2/18 at an economy of 4.5 runs per over. Shubham Gill showed a lot of grit with the score of 42 of 38 balls but with the rising scoreboard pressure succumbed to Deepak Chahar at a crucial time. &nbsp;Chennai today raised their fielding standards in crunch moments.

Used to be 8 top teams, now it&#39;s 10 teams. I won&#39;t say it&#39;s just another final. It&#39;s hard work of 2 months. Everybody has contributed. Yes, middle-order has not got ample opportunity. Gujarat Titans are a fantastic team and they&#39;ve chased very well, so the thought was to get them in. But it was a good toss to lose. If Jadeja gets conditions that help him. he&#39;s very difficult to hit. His bowling changed the game. Not to forget his partnership with Moeen. We try to create an environment and work out what is the strength of a fast bowler. We try to give them confidence and tell them &#39;Please try to explore your bowling&#39;. We try to motivate them as much as possible. The support staff is there, and Bravo and Eric are there. You see the wicket and according to that, you keep adjusting the field. I can be a very annoying captain, I keep shifting fielders 2-3 feet. The only request I ask from the fielders is, to keep an eye on me. If there&#39;s a dropped catch there will be no reaction, just keep an eye on me. I don&#39;t know. I have 8-9 months to decide. Why take that headache now? I will always be there for CSK, where it&#39;s playing or something outside.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad is Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad: &quot;&nbsp; Last three-four games in Chennai have been different. First few games wicket was better. But we have had to adapt to the conditions. Keep rotating strike, capitalize on loose balls. I have been lucky to have partners like Faf and Conway. both are great players. Faf was someone who was aggressive from the very go whereas Conway has great batsmanship. I would say the knock of 60 runs was more satisfying than the catch I took.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

We played a strong team tonight and an amazing century from Shubman. It was really wet in the second innings. It was wet in the first innings as well, but there wasn&#39;t a lot of grip in the second innings and also we had to change the ball quite a few times during the second innings. Virat Kohli played an unbelievable knock to give us a chance and thought that was a good score, but Shubman Gill played incredibly well to take the game away from us. From Our batting perspective, the top 4 contributed really well but we missed a few runs from the middle order consistently throughout the season, especially in the back end of the innings. Our bowlers in the middle overs perhaps didn&#39;t get as many wickets as we would have liked.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; The calmness the boys had was phenomenal. The way boys played ticked all the boxes. Shubman knows when he plays that kind of shot he gives no chance to the bowlers. He picked his spot and made it look easy. We would have taken 197 at the start, but we didn&#39;t bowl that well. Special innings from Virat Kohli. I can&#39;t ask anything better from the boys. Last year, everything went well for us. We were expecting people to challenge us.

I am happy that It is all working out for me at the business end of the tournament. You need to keep playing shots in T20 cricket. The new ball was holding a bit, it got easier to bat on. It was difficult for their spinners to bowl. Vijay Shankar was going too hard, I told him to hold his shape. Once he found the momentum, he can hit long as well. It&#39;s going to be an exciting qualifier contest playing against Chennai in Chennai. We have a great bowling attack and hopefully, we&#39;ll make it to the final for the second time in a row.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Pooran was the aggressor amongst the two smashing 58 runs from 30 balls which included 5 maximums and 4 fours. Sunil Narine picking 2 for 28 was the pick of the bowlers for KKR. In response to a target of 177, Jason Roy and Venky Iyer took KKR off to a flying start compiling 61 in the powerplay. LSG bowlers fought their way back in the middle overs courtesy of their spinners K Gowtham and Ravi Bishnoi. LSG picked 3 KKR wickets in the middle overs conceding at only 5.9 r.p.o. It was anyone&#39;s game when 63 runs were required from the last five overs. LSG looked on top after picking up Andre Rusell in the 16th over but it was not over as Rinku Singh was still batting. The batter smashed 20 runs from the 19th over and 20 again from the last over falling short by just one run in the end. Rinku Singh remained unbeaten on 67 from just 33 balls.

At one stage, they were 61/1 but I&#39;ve seen it before that at this level 2-3 tight overs and we can be right back in the game. And there was some grip for the spinners as well. Rinku Singh has been very special this year, every game when he is there you can&#39;t take it easy. Today he did it again. I told my bowlers to stick to the plans and take one ball at a time.

The home team is coming into this game on the back of a narrow win against the Punjab Kings where Rilee Rossouw was the top scorer and Prithvi Shaw displayed signs of good form. Warner and Co have already exited the playoff race and will be looking to end their campaign on a positive note. CSK on the other side is coming into the match on the back of a loss against the KKR. MSD and Co. have been consistent and shown balance in all their departments. But a win here is a necessity if the Yellow Army wants to make it to the playoffs. A win will take their tally to 17 and then they will not have to depend on other teams for their place in the top four. A crucial day game awaits between two sides full of talent where DC will play for pride whereas CSK will compete to cement their place in the top 4 of this year&#39;s edition.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (43)_1684577286.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#f39c12\">RUTURAJ GAIKWAD</span> VS <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">ANRICH NORTJE</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">DAVID WARNER</span> VS <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">THEEKSHANA</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (26)_1684577362.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nKevin Pietersen and Aaron Finch: &quot;62m square boundaries and 74m hit downtown. This pitch was watered a few hours ago, some grass cutting was put and was nicely rolled, the ground staff were worried about this pitch becoming very dry. It is still ver dry and the conditions are extremely hot at 41 degrees celsius. You will want to bat first here, there are some flaky cracks which could open up as the game progresses which will make the wicket slower and lower, and offer more turn. Batting will get difficult as the game goes on.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>TOSS:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> WINS THE TOSS AND ELECTS TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/toSS_1684577243.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>MSD, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;We will bat first.

Conway smashed his 6th half-century of the season and finished on 87 while Gaikwad scored 79 from 50 deliveries striking 7 maximums &amp; 3 fours. A cameo of 20 from 7 by Jadeja helped CSK post a mammoth score of 23 on the board. In response, DC failed to capitalize on the powerplay losing three wickets to CSK seamers. DC and Deshpande dented DC&#39;s scoring in the powerplay and thereafter the spinners took over to contain the home team. Only Warner looked good compiling 86 while no other batter even crossed the 15-run mark. All CSK bowlers were amongst wickets but Deepak Chahar picking 3 for 22 did maximum damage.&nbsp; CSK qualifies for the 12th time out of 14 IPL appearances which is the most by any team in the league.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>David Warner, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: Credit to CSK, the way they played today outbattled us in all three departments. We were a good pitch to bat on, boundaries in the powerplay would have put more pressure on their bowlers. There were some positives, we didn&#39;t bowl badly with the ball, we&#39;ll have to look at the positives and come back strongly next season. You have to back your game plan,&nbsp; try to score boundaries, and use your feet against spin. You can&#39;t get struggle against bowlers, partnerships would have been handy.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>MSD, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; There is no recipe for success, you try and pick the best players and give them the best slot to perform. And groom them in the areas where they are weak, somebody has to sacrifice their slot for the side. Credit to the Team management as well, they always back us. But, the players are most important, without the players, we can&#39;t do anything. I think death bowling, and confidence are very important. Tushar Deshpande has developed because he is able to execute under pressure, he has the confidence now. And when you keep playing the same players, it helps. I think the bowlers have also taken responsibility, Pathirana is quite a natural to bowling at the death but Deshpande has really developed there. I think we need to figure out and pick players who are team first - not bothered about individual performance and perform the best at knockout stages.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad: &quot;For us, it was a must-win game, and my 50th game for this franchise. Feels amazing to make a contribution in a crucial match. I think the wicket was slow and holding up, was difficult to hit fast bowlers but with spinners we thought we had an opportunity with short straight boundaries. We set the platform for the middle order and thought we could attack later on. Glad that happened.</strong></span></p>\n",

Sam Curran and Jitesh Sharma formed a solid partnership of 64 from 44 to keep PBKS in the game. The onslaught began with Shahrukh Khan who took the attack to the opposition smashing 41 at a strike rate of 178 taking PBKS to a challenging total of 187. Adam Zampa&#39;s spell conceded at only 6.50 r.p.o restricting PBKS scoring to some extent. In response, RR once again lost Buttler Eaerly who registered his fifth duck of the season but the two Indian Southpaws Jaiswal and Padikkal kept going at a brisk rate. Hetmyer coming in at number 5 smacked 3 maximums and 4 fours which helped RR catch up to the asking rate.

Our bowling was good in patches but the fielding was not that good. The dropped chances cost us the match. I feel 200 would have been a good total on this wicket. Speaking about the season, We could have done better in all departments. Sometimes the batters were clicking and sometimes the bowling unit was doing well. &nbsp;We failed to put up those performances together.

We have a quality team and it is dissapointing to see where we are on the points table. I have been talking about Yashasvi Jaiswal almost every game now. He has shown immense levels of maturity. It feels as if he has played 100 T20 Internationals. Every match we feel Trent will pick a wicket for us in the first over.

The hosts are out of playoff contention whereas their counterparts still have a chance to make it to the top four. A win today will take the Visitor&#39;s tally to 14 and put them in an advantageous position before their last encounter against GT which also happens to be the last league game of the tournament. Other teams that would be interested in this game are CSK and LSG who will make it to the playoffs if RCB suffers a defeat at the hands of SRH. Faf and Co. have had a few concerns with their middle-order batting but their Top Order has done remarkably well to make it up for that. The bowling side came good in the previous encounter against RR and would be expected to repeat the feat against SRH whose batting lineup has struggled through the tournament. While SRH plays for pride, RCB will play to keep their hopes alive for the playoff qualifications.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (41)_1684417807.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">VIRAT KOHLI</span> VS <span style=\"color:#d35400\">BHUVNESHWAR KUMAR</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">RAHUL TRIPATHI</span> VS <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">MOHAMMAD SIRAJ</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Venue Stats (3)_1684417850.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (24)_1684418185.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nAaron Finch and Deep Dasgupta: &quot; This is the center pitch. The Square boundaries are around 60 meters. The wicket is an absolute beauty as it is pretty even with not even a blade of grass out of place. Seems to be on the drier side though. It has been watered but with the weather being so hot, it&#39;s just a bit dry. There are a few cracks but I wouldn&#39;t be worried about that. Once players get their spikes chewing the wicket up a little bit, you&#39;ll start to get the ball slowing down and spin playing a major part later on. Batting first seems to be ideal here. The Curator reckons that there hasn&#39;t been much dew. This pitch could turn a little. Might not be a high-scoring match.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> WINS THE TOSS AND ELECTS TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; FIRST</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/toSS_1684418898.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;We will bowl first. The last two nights We&#39;ve had dew here. Looks like a Good Wicket but slightly on the slower side. We are going on with the same team as last game. Wanindu Hasaranga has a niggle.

So Not very disappointed with the toss result. we have a couple of changes to our side. Harry Brook comes back. Kartik Tyagi comes in as well. Umran Malik is an X-factor player. We have a lot of pride to play for. We haven&#39;t lived up to the ability we possess. But we would try to display that at the world stage in the last two matches.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

But a partnership between Klaasen and Markram brought SRH back into the match. An outstanding Knock from Heinrich Klaasen helped SRH post a mammoth total of 186 on the board. The South African batter went on to hit his maiden IPL Ton off just 51 balls. Mohammad Siraj was the most economical bowler while Bracwell was amongst the wickets for RCB. In response, the Opening pair of Faf and Virat came out all guns blazing and took the attack to the opposition from the very first delivery of the innings. A partnership of 172 between the two gave no chance to the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> bowlers to get into the game. Kohli the aggressor amongst the two went on to make his 6th Century of the league while Faf compiled 71 getting to his 8th Half Century of the season.

We could have added a few more in the powerplay. Great contribution from Klaasen. But I still feel it was a good score. Good to see great support not just for us but also for RCB as well. We weren&#39;t able to give them a win. We all hate losing. However, we always look to win. Hopefully, have smiles at the end of the campaign. It was an excellent knock from Faf and Virat. We will look at some of these guys moving forward. We were probably one bowler short in the powerplay. Kartik was put under tremendous pressure. The plans were all in place but we failed to execute it. Mayank was very impressive. It was a special knock from Klaasen. I feel Super happy for the guy. I don&#39;t think he would have dreamed of getting an IPL hundred.

That was my first reaction. I did feel after the first innings that 200 was a par score in that pitch. &nbsp;Spinners didn&#39;t get a turn from this pitch. The batters have done well for us and in the previous match, we were also clinical with the ball. I and Kohli we complement each other well. We play in very different areas so it&#39;s difficult for the bowlers. We are good friends on and off the field. The next match is at Chinnaswamy which will be an amazing game in front of the home crowd.

Thought SRH got a very good score. Ball was gripping as well. Faf has been on a different level. I&#39;ve had a quiet couple of matches. The way I was striking in the nets wasn&#39;t transitioning into the middle. I personally have never looked at my past records and did not think much about their record against us. I put myself under so much stress already that I forget that I have scored 6 centuries in IPL. I don&#39;t care what anyone says on the outside. I&#39;ve never been a guy who plays so many fancy shots. It&#39;s Test cricket coming up after the IPL so have to stay true to my technique and be positive.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The home team <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> which is still in contention for the playoffs will be looking to continue on the winning momentum gained in the last game by going past the same opponent by a margin of 31 runs. Prabhsimran Singh scoring a century was the highlight of the match. PBKS has won 6 out of their 12 fixtures and stands at number 8 on the points table. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> on the other side are having a season to forget as they are already out of the playoff race. Warner and Co have nothing to play for but pride while PBKS considering their NRR would want to win big in this game to strengthen their chance to make it to the top four.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (40)_1684331757.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nSimon Doull and Matthew Hayden: &quot;We are 1457 metres above sea level, that makes a difference when it comes to dimensions and boundary hitting. The boundary dimensions are 65 metres square on each side while the straight hit is 76 metres. The pitch seems to be an absolute beauty and it hasn&#39;t had a lot of wear and tear. When you look at the wicket, it is really hard, not a lot of movement in these cracks whatsoever. A good covering of grass means the Pacers are gonna be in play throughout the game. One can expect this to play out as a good wicket to bat on. 180 seems like a par score. The outfield looks absolutely magnificent it&#39;s been relaid, looks pristine and we&#39;re set for a cracking night here in Dharamshala.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>GROUND DIMENSIONS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (23)_1684331810.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">PRABHSIMRAN SINGH</span> VS <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">ISHANT SHARMA</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">DAVID WARNER</span> VS <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">ARSHDEEP SINGH</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">PBKS WINS THE TOSS AND ELECTS TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Shikhar Dhawan, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp; We will field.

Warner and Co came out all guns blazing after being asked to bat first. A 94-run stand between Shaw and Warner set the platform for the middle order to follow. Rossouw who came at number three was game from ball one, the swashbuckling batter smashed 82 runs from just 37 balls at a staggering strike rate of 222. A mammoth target of 214 was never going to be easy to chase down especially after playing a maiden to Khaleel and losing the Skipper Shikhar Dhawan for a duck. Atharva Taide did manage to score a half-century but was unable to strike according to the asking rate which was always creeping. It was Livingstone who unleashed himself when 79 were required from the last four. It came down to 38 from the last 2 when Nortje bowled a match-winning over which gave away only 5 runs. Liam Livingstone the lone warrior did strike a few in the final over too but failed to get <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> over the line. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> clinched the game by a margin of 15 runs eventually.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> Captain: &quot;It is frustrating. We didn&#39;t bowl really well in the powerplay. We should have taken some wickets while it was swinging. It&#39;s quite a close game, but can&#39;t help it. Livingstone played a great knock, unfortunately, we couldn&#39;t end up on the winning side. I feel my decision to bowl spin-off the last over backfired. In this sort of a wicket, whether we take wickets or not, we should bowl at the right areas which we are not doing for quite a long time. For every powerplay, we have been giving 50-60 runs, we should be taking wickets as well. I got out and the 1st over was also a maiden.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>David Warner, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp; Very bad fielding performance to be honest. Playing on a nice batting wicket helped. Was pretty challenging at home. It was nice to see Prithvi bat the way he did. Rilee Rossouw played an amazing knock as well. We needed some consistency at our home venue but unfortunately did not happen. We haven&#39;t been able to work out a total at home.

Happy that I could perform for the team. As David Warner mentioned was a good wicket to bat on. Davey and Shaw put up a good partnership at the top. I enjoyed some momentum when I came into the bat. Just shows that this game is not over till the last ball is bowled. Exceptional innings from Liam Livingstone in the second innings.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

A win here will boost LSG&#39;s chances to make it to the playoffs. They will be confident going into the game as they are riding on the winning momentum gained in the previous encounter against SRH. Prerak Mankad scored his maiden fifty while Pooran and Stoinis displayed their power-hitting prowess. Pacers Yudhvir Singh and Yash Thakur were economical while Skipper Krunal Pandya was amongst the wickets. The bowlers will have their task cut out against an MI unit whose batting has fired all cylinders in their last few encounters. The main threat being Suryakumar Yadav who scored his maiden century and looked unstoppable against GT. It will be interesting to see how Rohit Sharma and Co bat against the LSG spinners on a slow track at Ekana. Piyush Chawla who has been the MI&#39;s top wicket taker with 19 scalps will be key at this venue. A rampant MI having won 4 out of their 5 games will be looking to end the losing streak against LSG. Also, a win here will Make them favorites to finish in the top 2. The two teams are in contention for a place in the playoffs, and the encounter proves to be a crucial one not just for them but for a few other teams who are in contention.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (39)_1684244719.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (22)_1684244774.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nKevin Pietersen and Deep Dasgupta: &nbsp;&quot; &nbsp;It is 75 metres on one side and 61 metres on the other side.

But the way we started with the batin the powerplay put us in a good position, but as I said we lost our way in the second half.

The defending Champions have been consistent throughout the season having lost only 4 out of their 12 games and thus find themselves at the top of the table. Skipper Hardik Pandya will be in a secure head space as all their departments are firing and there seems to be no real weakness in the side. Shubman Gill has been the top run-getter while Rashid Khan who holds the purple cap with 23 Wickets is doing damage with the ball. Likes of Vijay Shankar, Saha, and Skipper Pandya himself have had some decent outings and would be looking to replicate the same at the business end of the tournament. The bowling side of things also looks solid with Shami leading the pace attack and Mohit Sharma being his aid. The visitors on the other side have a formidable side on paper but have failed to translate that into their on-field performances. The Orange army has won just 4 out of their 11 fixtures which finds them in the second last position on the points table. Although the team has an outside chance to make it to the playoff that will depend on a lot of permutations after <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> win all their remaining fixtures.

We are playing on pitch number 8. The ground Dimensions are 74 metres and 58 metres square while straight hit is 70 metres. It&#39;s a fresh wicket, which has not been used so far. There&#39;s a bit of moisture, but it&#39;s a hot day, so this moisture is expected to dry out in a couple of hours. There are certain spots which are a little darker than the usual pitch. Once the moisture dries out, it seems like a good pitch to bat on. It will be a contest between the batters at the Narendra Modi stadium.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Venue Stats (2)_1684160199.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>TOSS:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /><strong> WINS THE TOSS AND ELECTS TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;FIRST</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/toSS_1684160162.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Aiden Markram, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We are gonna bowl, looks like there is little moisture on this wicket, something for the pacers to utilize early on. &nbsp;We have been playing really good cricket but not getting over the line.

SRH struck early picking up Saha in the first over but Shubman Gill and Sai Sudarshan applied themselves well playing proper cricketing shots all around the park. A 147-run stand between the two put GT in the driver&#39;s seat. Gill scored his maiden IPL ton while Sai Sudarshan compiled 47 from 36 deliveries. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the bowlers picking up a fifer for just 30 runs from his four. Chasing 189 was never going to be easy especially after not being able to make the most of the powerplay. Mohammad Shami once again stepped up in the powerplay picking 3 wickets in the powerplay leaving very little scope for SRH to stage a comeback. Mohit Sharma with his bag of tricks scalped 4 in the middle overs and completed a clean sweep for the Titans. Klaasen making his second fifty of the season was the lone warrior who lacked support from the other batters. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> fell short by 34 runs and now is the second team to get eliminated from the race of the playoffs. &nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Aiden Markram, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We were in the match at the halfway mark but when you lose 4 wickets in the powerplay, it becomes tough. We were slightly off with our bowling, to be honest. We&#39;ve got high-class bowlers who can swing the ball both ways. Shubman Gill&#39;s innings were amazing and so did their number three Sai Sudarshan. Klaasen is a great player and I&#39;m very pleased for him, the world can see the class and power that he possesses. The rest of us haven&#39;t complimented him. We have to play for pride now. We&#39;ll try to give some opportunities to youngsters. &nbsp;It&#39;ll be nice to finish off the season in good spirits but unfortunately, we haven&#39;t been good enough in the tournament this year.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;Very proud of the boys, two in two in making it to the playoffs. The boys put their hands up and in challenging situations and we rightly deserve the playoff spot. &nbsp;We ticked a lot of good boxes as all our departments have fired, we made a lot of errors but we were always there in the game and tried to stay consistent.

The current form makes CSK the clear favorites and the fact that <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> has not been able to win a game since 2013 at Chepauk does not help KKR&#39;s cause either.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (37)_1684073124.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (19)_1684073177.png\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nSanjay Manjrekar and Matthew Hayden: &nbsp;&quot; &nbsp;61 meters &amp; 70 meters are the square boundaries while it is 77 meters down the ground. &nbsp;A dry wicket.

We are slightly unsure about the pitch, and as the tournament has progressed the pitch gets slow. Throughout the years, we have told openers to assess the pitch quickly and find what&#39;s a good target. After the ball loses its shine we can revisit the score and the target we need to post on the board. I think we have done really well, but fielding is one department where we need to step up. Can improve 5-10%.

Spinners Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy were successful in picking wickets as well as keeping the scoring in check. CSK managed only 40 runs in the middle overs losing 4 wickets. Narine gave only 15 runs from his four accounting for two crucial wickets. Shivam Dube&#39;s unbeaten 48(34) helped CSK post 144 on the board. In response, KKR did not get the best of starts losing 3 wickets in the powerplay to Deepak Chahar. But a match-winning partnership of 99 from 77 between Skipper Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh for the 4 th wicket took the game away from the hosts.

Just the conditions had a big impact on the game. Very happy with what Shivam Dube has done, but important that he is not satisfied and wants to keep improving.

It is a Royal Rumble where both teams would be fighting to stay in the race of the playoffs. The hosts have 12 points to their credit from their 12 games while RCB has 10 points from their 11 encounters so far. The visitors will have to do well in terms of their Net run rate which does not look so good at the moment. The onus will be on the Top three of Faf, Kohli, and Maxwell who have been doing all the scoring for RCB while the middle order has struggled to get going. Skipper Faf Du Plessis holds the orange cup with 576 runs in the league. Bowlers Hasaranga and Vyshak Vijaykumar have picked wickets but have been on the expensive side while Hazlewood has not had any major impact in the three games so far. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> on the other side are riding on the momentum gained in their previous encounter against KKR. Jaiswal setting a record for the fastest fifty off 13 balls is the primary reason. Buttler and Samson have been in good form too. The Spin attack is led by Yuzi Chahal who is now the highest wicket of the Cash rich league. Ashwin has complimented him well from the other end. Boult will lead the pace attack in the company of Sandeep Sharma. A mouth Watering contest awaits between Two top sides that will compete to stay in the race of the playoffs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (36)_1684058856.png\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (17)_1684058907.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nWV Raman and Simon Katich. : &nbsp;&quot; &nbsp;We are playing on pitch5 at the SMS Stadium, this is the center pitch. In terms of dimensions, the square boundaries are 66m while the straight boundaries are longer at 78m. There was some cloud cover in the morning which has now disappeared. Second time this pitch is being used after the RRvCSK game, There were runs in that and it will be high scoring again. The pitch looks tough, with some cracks and grass cover in the middle. Because it&#39;s a day game, the ball might slow up a bit due to the heat.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">RCB WINS THE TOSS AND ELECTS TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/toSS_1684058951.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" /></span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf Du Plessis, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;We will bat.

We just need to execute better. 3-4 guys are putting their hand up every match, we need a bit more probably to cash in on some good positions.

There are a few niggles that players carry through the tournament, but the support staff has done a good job managing that.

Maxwell coming in at 3 took the attack to the opposition in the middle overs while Faf played second fiddle from the other end.

But that is the way, Jaiswal, and Buttler have been playing throughout the tournament. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think I have an answer to the collapse yet. We all know the nature of the league, anything can happen at any time. We have to be strong, take a day off, and think about the upcoming match in Dharamshala.

We also managed to capitalize on the momentum shift at the end. Michael Bracewell would want to bowl like this every day of the week, especially on a track like this.

It is going to be a slow, low surface, it is not going to change much. There might be some dew later on the field. The last game was not a good one but winning 4 out of 5 was quite good. The boys have come out with a clear mind.

After winning the toss and electing to bowl first, Ishant Sharma (On his 100th game) took two wickets in two overs within the powerplay after which Axar stroked early and limited PBKS to 46/3 in the powerplay! But it was one man - Prabhsimran who looked like playing on a different pitch while the others were struggling to meet the ball! Prabhsimran registered his maiden century and scored 61% of the runs of his team! His contribution took the team to a total of 167 runs.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>In the second innings when DC batted, it was their game to win as they went very strong in the powerplay with 65 runs for no loss! The trouble all began when Harpreet Brar accounted for his first wicket in the 7th over after which the Spinners took 4 wickets in the three overs! The momentum shifted rightly on their side and they capitalized to restrict the opposition to 134 runs. Harpreet Brar was the man with the ball as he scalped 4 wickets!!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>David Warner, DC captain: &quot;It was about trying to restrict them to a decent total. They got more than we thought. Prabhsimran batted really well. Catch drops cost us. After the powerplay when you lose six wickets for 30 runs, we are not going to win. We will play with freedom on our remaining games for pride. Another disappointing effort with the bat after the good start we had. We found the right combination but we keep losing quick wickets and you can&#39;t afford that at this level.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, PBKS Captain: &quot;It was amazing how the way the bowlers brought us back in the game. All credit to our spinners and also our fast bowlers as well. It was turning early and playing that kind of knock is just incredible and amazing from Prabhsimran. That helped us reach that decent total. I told Harpreet to keep it slow and target the wickets and the way he stood up and took those wickets was really fantastic. Very happy with the way youngsters are growing and maturing. This win has brought a lot of confidence for us.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Prabhsimran Singh is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Prabhsimran Singh: &quot;We lost a few wickets so the plan was to take the game deeper. I have been with the team for a long time and when you get opportunities you have to grab it completely. The wicket was slightly tough at the start and the plan was to build some partnership by targetting a few bowlers. Really thankful to the management for the opportunities.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The hosts have been inconsistent this season and thus find themselves at the second-last spot on the points table with just 4 wins out of their 10 games. SRH will need to win all their games to stay in the playoff contention. The positive for the home camp is that they have managed to get over the line in 2 out of their last 3 fixtures. Abhishek Sharma has shown good form after being promoted in the batting order while Rahul Tripathi has been their top run-getter. Glenn Phillips and Klaasen have fared well in the recent encounters but the concern is the form of their Skipper Aiden Markram who has struggled so far. The pace unit has many big names but has not been able to replicate the same in their performances. Markande with 11 wickets is their top wicket-taker. LSG on the other side started well but have lost their momentum thereafter, the team has just won 2 out of their last 7 fixtures. Mayers has been striking well at the top and QDK played a solid knock in the previous game but the concern remains in the middle order where the Likes of Hooda, Krunal Pandya, and Marcus Stoinis have failed to get going. The spin attack consisting of Ravi Bishnoi, Amit Mishra, and Skipper Krunal Pandya has done a good job but the pacers have leaked runs. LSG would look to find form and bounce back to winning ways while SRH will fight to live another day in the tournament!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (34)_1683971827.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;Matthew Hayden: &nbsp;&quot; &nbsp;The square boundaries are 63 metres and 64 metres respectively, while the straighter hit is 73 metres.

Powerplay yielded 56 runs but LSG came back well in restricting the scoring in the middle over slab. Krunal Pandya picking two big wickets of Markram and Phillps was the pick of the bowlers for LSG while Klaasen scored 47 at a strike rate of 162 top scored for the Super Giants. In response, LSG started slow but a well-composed partnership of 73 between Prerak Mankad who came in at number 3 and Marcus Stoinis kept LSG in the hunt. SRH was in control for most part of the innings but an onslaught from Nicholas Pooran made it look easy to chase down the total. The Southpaw from West Indies smashed 44 runs from 13 balls to take LSG home with 4 balls to spare. LSG once again make their way back in the top 4 moving another step closer to the spot in the playoffs.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Aiden Markram: &quot;It was a good score, I thought 180 was par. We batted nicely, but probably lacked one partnership that could have got us to the 200-run mark. The wicket got slower throughout the day, we would have taken this total at the start, to be honest. Pressure is an interesting thing, and the guys tried their best. When you are put under the pump by high-quality players like Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran, you will be tested. Now It&#39;s about the guys using the next three games as opportunities, they must make it count.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Krunal Pandya: &quot;With the way they were going I thought 200 was likely, but we pulled it back at the end, especially by Yash Thakur and Avesh Khan. At this level anything is possible, we had the belief and with players like Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran. We knew we had to go and there was nothing special luckily it paid off for us and Abhishek over-changed the momentum. Prerak Mankad coming in for his first season and to come out and bat like that shows a lot about his character, really happy for him to come out here and score those runs.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Prerak Mankad: &quot;Most important game for us, my score does not matter to me, whichever team I play I want to contribute. I was trying to hit the spinners and couldn&#39;t connect, I knew Mayank would try to get me out and I have played against him in domestic cricket, so took my chance. Thanks to the management for giving me this opportunity. &quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

The hosts have done well lately winning 3 out of their last 4 fixtures. What stands out is MI&#39;s performance while chasing, the team has been able to chase down 200+ targets with ease. Ishan Kishan is providing flying starts while Suryakumar Yadav back in his elements is the major reason behind MI&#39;s recent success in run chases. Nehal Wadera and Tilak Varma in the middle order have displayed that they have the temperament to do well at this level. The likes of Cam Green and Tim David make the batting look formidable, to say the least. The bowling side of things is in the hands of Piyush Chawla who has picked 17 wickets so far. The pace attack will be managed by Behrendorff and Chris Jordan who has been inducted as a replacement of Jofra Archer. The defending Champions on the other side have been the most consistent team losing only 3 out of their 11 games. All their departments have&nbsp; fired and there is no real weakness within the camp. Shubman Gill is the top scorer while Saha has been given complete freedom to attack from ball one. Hardik Pandya has a few fifties to his name while Vijay Shankar too has displayed signs of good form. Likes of Miller, Abhinav Manohar and Rahul Tewatia provide that extra cushion for the middle order to play freely. Mohammad Shami and Rashid Khan with 19 wickets apiece have done exceedingly well while Mohit Sharma and Noor Ahmed who joined the team rather late have fit into their roles perfectly. It is a mouth-watering contest between GT&#39;s bowling and MI&#39;s batting. Considering the pitch, recent record and the quality the two possess in their batting, it would not be wrong to say that a score over 200 is definitely on the cards!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (33)_1683900822.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>FUN FACT:&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;HAS NEVER LOST A GAME ON THE 12TH OF MAY!&nbsp; CAN <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> CREATE AN UPSET FOR THE HOME TEAM FANS AT THE WANKHEDE?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT:</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">MOHAMMAD SHAMI</span></strong> <strong>VS</strong> <strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">ROHIT SHARMA</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">PIYUSH CHAWLA</span></strong> <strong>VS</strong> <strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">HARDIK PANDYA</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (14)_1683900880.png\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nSanjay Manjrekar and Aaron Finch: &nbsp;&quot; &#39;It is a red soil wicket today. 61m and 67m are the square boundaries while the straight fence is at 72m. The pitch looks similar to that of the other night against RCB. There is a bit of moisture on top of the surface which means there could be a bit of swing too, especially in the first 3-4 overs, and a hint of turn if the captain is brave enough to go for a spin in the powerplay. But this is a beautiful wicket to bat on, winning the toss and chasing down the target later on is the ideal thing to do. No score is safe at Wankhede.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Venue Stats (1)_1683900918.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> WINS THE TOSS AND ELECTS TO <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/gt dC_1683900953.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;We will bowl.

MI got off to a flying start after being asked to bat first by Hardik Pandya. 61 runs without losing a wicket set a great platform for the middle order to come and express themselves. Ishan Kishan was instrumental in the first six while Skipper Rohit Sharma managed to get some runs under his belt. But the onslaught began while Suryakumar Yadav unleashed the beast within. SKY single-handedly took the attack to the opposition despite losing partners at the other end. Playing some breathtaking shots to all corners of the park led him to his maiden IPL 100. Rashid Khan picking four wickets was the only bowler who caused problems for the MI batters. Chasing 219 was never going to be easy, especially after losing 3 wickets within the powerplay. MI spinners kept chipping in with wickets and the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> middle order could not cope with the ever-increasing asking rate. Mumbai were well on course for a big-margin victory but Rashid Khan had different plans. The Afghani All-rounder out of nowhere led the counterattack of his own. Khan smashed 10 maximums and 3 fours remaining unbeaten on 79 from just 32 balls. Akash Madhwal picking up 3 wickets for just 31 runs was the pick of the bowlers for MI.

The way he bowled, the way he batted, it was tremendous overall. Don&#39;t have to try much after this result, have to keep it simple. As a group, we weren&#39;t there tonight. In bowling also we were very flat. Did not have clear plans or didn&#39;t execute them either. Wicket was very flat but I felt we gave 25 runs extra. Suryakumar Yadav is one of the best batters in T20 cricket. You saw what he can do if you don&#39;t execute your plans .&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;<br />\nRohit Sharma, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />Skipper: &quot; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was indeed an interesting game especially from our point of view, happy to get the two points. It&#39;s pleasing to bat first and then come out and defend the total. We kept picking wickets and in this format, you have to do that, great bowling effort from our bowlers. SKY has got confidence in his abilities. We wanted to keep the right-left combination but SKY came in and said no, he wanted to go in.

Whenever I score runs the team should win. Most importantly we batted first today and said that we would keep the same tempo when you are chasing 200-220. There was a lot of dew on the ground, it was there from the 7-8th over and I knew what shots to play on the wicket, I was not thinking about hitting straight, I had two shots in mind , one over the third man and one over fine leg. I practice them before the game, so when I come into the game I am very clear and just go express myself.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Both teams have secured 10 points winning 5 out of their respective 11 matches. The only thing that separates them is the NRR which finds <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> on the 5th position on the points table one ahead of their opposition. The Visitors started the tournament on a high note and also occupied the top place on the points table for a brief period but lost their way thereafter. RR has lost 5 out of their last 6 encounters and have underperformed despite all their players being in decent form. The openers Jaiswal and Buttler have been successful in getting the team off to a good start while Samson has done a fair job at number three. Padikkal and Jurel have looked promising while the team will require their finisher Hetmyer to step up and get going as we come close to the business end of the tournament. Yuzi Chahal has been the top wicket-taker with 17 against his name while Ashwin has complimented him well from the other end. Boult and Sandeep Sharma will lead the pace attack. KKR on the other side have come back into the tournament in some fashion. The team has won 3 out of their last 4 games and has the winning momentum on their side. Skipper Nitish Rana has been the top run-getter for KKR while Roy who has 2 fifties in 5 games has been able to get KKR off to a flying start. Rinku Singh has taken up the responsibility of finishing the innings while Andre Russell getting some runs in the previous games makes the batting lineup look destructive. Varun Chakravarthy is the spearhead and has been able to provide breakthroughs at crucial moments. Other spinners Narine and Suyash Sharma have done a good job playing second fiddle. The two teams have all the ingredients to make this an exciting contest at Eden Gardens!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (32)_1683814360.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (13)_1683814284.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nRohan Gavaskar: &nbsp;&quot; The square boundaries are between 55 and 73 meters around the ground.

First, it was Yuzi Chahal who became the highest Wicket taker of the league, and then Yashasvi Jaiswal who smashed a half-century in just 13 balls. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> were spot on to bowl first after winning the toss and restricted KKR to just 37 runs in 6 overs. The middle over slab was dominated by RR spinners, especially Yuzi Chahal who picked four wickets and gave nothing away to the opposition. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> were reduced to just 149. In response, Jaiswal smashed 26 runs from the first over from Nitish Rana and thereafter there was no shift in the momentum. A clean sweep for the Royals where Jaiswal finished unbeaten on 98 (47) and Samson playing second fiddle scoring 48 from 29. A win like this will boost RR&#39;s NRR which will definitely help them go further in the tournament.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Sanju Samson,<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;I didn&#39;t need to do anything tonight.

The hosts are sitting nicely on the second position with 6 wins out of their 11 matches. MSD and Co have been consistent and all their departments are firing. Devon Conway has scored 458 runs so far and is in the race for the orange cap while his partner Ruturaj Gaikwad has complimented him well from the other end. The middle order looks formidable in the presence of Shivam Dube and Ajinkya Rahane while Ravindra Jadeja and Moeen Ali add depth to both bowling and batting. CSK would be happy with the way Tushar Deshpande has been performing, the pacer has scalped 19 wickets and is right on top of the highest wicket-takers list. Pathirana is another bowler that has impressed everyone with the way he has gone about his business at the death. A confident looking CSK would be looking to get one step closer to securing a berth in the playoffs against a team that is at the last spot on the points table. The points table fails to tell the complete story as DC after straight losses have come back winning 4 out of their last 5 games. DC went past RCB chasing down a target of 182 runs in just 16.4 overs. Phil Salt&#39;s 87 runs off 45 deliveries was the highlight of the match. DC&#39;s Top Four of Skipper David Warner, Phil Salt. Mitchell Marsh and Rilee Roussouw look in good form. Spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel would be expected to come good at Chepauk where the surface has assistance for spin.

In response, DC had a dismal start losing 3 wickets in the powerplay even before spinners came to operate. Manish Pandey and Rilee Roussouw gathered 59 runs from 59 balls but the asking rate just kept increasing as CSK spinners gave nothing away. DC was able to compile only 44 in the middle overs and there was very little scope left to stage a comeback. In the end, it was a very comfortable victory for CSK by 27 runs.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>David Warner, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp; Losing three wickets in the powerplay is not acceptable. We lost a wicket in the 1st over which has been happening frequently. We understand that our opening combination is crucial but has failed to fire. We lost a wicket to a run-out which did not help the cause either. We threw wickets away not that the bowlers bowled too well. Put too much pressure on ourselves in chasing down a &nbsp;gettable total. To sum it up, we needed a better powerplay.

We did not know what&#39;s a par score. That&#39;s why I wanted the bowlers to bowl their best deliveries but not look for wickets every delivery. That&#39;s when you start not bowling well. I felt 166-170 was a good score. But as a batting unit, we could have done better. The good thing is Moeen Ali and Ravindra Jadeja got a chance to spend time in the middle.

Both teams have had a similar run so far having won 5 out of their 10 matches. The hosts will look to bounce back after their loss against CSK at Chepauk and gain winning momentum as we enter the business end of the tournament. MI&#39;s concern has been their top order which has been inconsistent especially the form of their Skipper Rohit Sharma. The middle order comprising of Tilak Varma, Nehal Wadera, and Tim David is doing well while Suryakumar Yadav regaining his form is the biggest positive for MI. The pace bowling department has never looked settled and Jofra Archer being ruled out does not help the cause either. Piyush Chawla is the only silver lining in that bowling set up with 17 wickets this season. On the other side, RCB bats top-heavy with Virat Kohli, Faf Du Plessis, and Glenn Maxwell all in good striking form. Kohli has already scored 6 half centuries while Faf has compiled 5 this season. They will fancy their chances against MI bowling which has leaked runs this tournament. RCB&#39;s major concern is its middle order which has failed to fire and have any major impact so far. Although, Mahipal Lomror did show signs of good form in their previous encounter against DC in a losing cause. Mohammad Siraj has been doing well and Harshal Patel does complement him well enough. With Josh Hazlewood in the mix, RCB&#39;s Pace bowling looks much better. Both teams have similar issues and would want to address them at the earliest.

The hosts find themselves at the 8th spot on the points table having won only 4 out of the 10 games this season. They will now have to win all their matches to make it to the playoffs. KKR is coming into this fixture on the back of a win against SRH and would look to use the momentum to get past PBKS which is not doing that great either. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> are one spot above KKR with 5 wins from their 10 clashes this season. Shikhar Dhawan and Co. lost their previous encounter against MI but will be confident coming into this clash as they have already won against KKR in the first leg clash this year. Skipper Nitish Rana and Rinku Singh are in good batting form while Varun Chakravarthy has been their top wicket-getter so far. Looking at the PBKS side, Liam Livingstone holds the key to their success. Jitesh Sharma striking at 165 is another X factor that PBKS possesses and would be a player to watch out for in this all-important encounter. Looking at how the pitch has played at this venue, one can expect a high-scoring encounter between two sides that are looking for some change in their fortune.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (29)_1683554540.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT FOR:</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>SHIKHAR DHAWAN</strong></span> <strong>VS</strong> <strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">VARUN CHAKRAVARTHY</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>DRE RUSS</strong></span> <strong>VS</strong> <span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>RAHUL CHAHAR</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (7)_1683554608.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Mark Howard and Pommie Mbangwa</strong>. : &quot;The off-side is short just 58 meters but over to the leg-side it is quite big,71 meters. The average first innings score is 222 this season. When you look at the wicket, it&#39;s got a mosaic effect and looks quite firm. It looks a little drier than last time. It might spin a little more. The bowlers need to make them hit to the longer square side, be it pace or spin.

Shikhar Dhawan top scored with 57(47) runs for PBKS. KKR got off to a decent start courtesy of Jason Roy who smashed 8 boundaries taking the attack on the opposition. Nitish Rana once again led by example and compiled 51 from 38 balls. But Economical spells from Rahul Chahar and Nathan Ellis kept PBKS in the game. It was anyone&#39;s game after the dismissal of Nitish Rana in the 16th over. It was Dre Russ and Rinku Singh in the middle when KKR needed 51 from the last 4 overs. The big man took the responsibility and showed his power-hitting prowess smashing 3 fours and 3 big sixes under pressure.

And that six-over point put the icing on the cake. I wanted to finish the game off, but we have a finisher this year in Rinku. Rinku Singh told me what if the ball beats you, should we go for the run? I said for sure, I have faith in him to finish it last ball. I get goosebumps seeing him doing what he&#39;s been doing.

The hosts were able to start the season on a high note but have lost track thereafter losing 4 out of their last 5 games. The major reason behind that is the form of Jos Buttler and Sanju Samson. Even Shimron Hetmyer has not been able to fire as the left-handed West-Indian batter has 5 single-digit scores in the last five games. This puts more responsibility on the shoulders of Jasiwal, Padikkal, and Jurel who have been scoring runs for RR. Yashasvi Jaiswal is number 4 on the list of run-getters this season and already has scored a century in this year&#39;s edition. The spin attack is well-rounded in the presence of Ashwin and Chahal while the Pace attack is in the safe hands of Boult and Sandeep Sharma. RR will look to bounce back against SRH which has been out of sorts this season. One of the best-looking sides on paper has failed to deliver so far and finds themselves in a situation where they have to win all games to stand a chance to make it to the playoffs. Aiden Markram, Mayank Agarwal, Harry Brook, and Abhishek Sharma have been inconsistent while Klaasen has been good in patches. The fast bowling unit comprising T Natarajan, Bhuvaneshwar Kumar, Umran Malik, and Marco Jansen has not had any major impact. The only positive is the performance of the leg spinner Mayank Markande who is SRH&#39;s top wicket-taker with 11 scalps to his credit. SRH will have to think out of the box if they want to get past the Royals at Sawai Mansingh Stadium.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Head to Head:-</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (36)_1683469618.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nSamuel Badree and Nick Knight:</strong> &quot;68 and 63 are the square boundaries, and 78 meters straight down the ground. &nbsp;This is the same pitch that was used in the last game.

SRH showed us today that it is not over until the last ball is bowled or we can say the last legal ball is bowled. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> once again got off to a flying start courtesy of Yashasvi Jaswal and Jos Buttler who put together 54 in the first five overs. Samson coming in at number three seemed in a similar mood. Samson and Buttler put together 138 and took the team to a mammoth total of 214. Buttler top scored with 95 (59) while Skipper Samson remained unbeaten on 66 &nbsp;from 38.

All top 4 got starts and kept up with the tempo of the run chase. Abhishek Sharma was the top scorer with 55 from 34. RR came back into the match when Yuzi Chahal was brought back into the attack in the 16th over when he dismissed Klaasen and then went on to pick Tripathi and Markram in the 18th over of the game. It looked very difficult for SRH to score 41 from 12 balls, especially with two new batters at the crease. But Glenn Phillips smashing 3 sixes and a four against Kuldip Yadav changed the entire scenario. SRH had momentum on their side until a spectacular catch from Shimron Hetmyer helped dismiss the dangerous Phillips. It was up to Samad to make 17 runs from the last over from Sandeep Sharma. Sharma was delivering well under pressure and even got the wicket of Samad but did not realize that he had overstepped. Abdul Samad striking a six off the last ball to take the team home was the most dramatic finish we have seen this year.

But that no ball made us realize that. We played really well with the bat, but the credit has to go to them. I think if it&#39;s a no-ball you have to bowl it again. We were happy with the target that we posted. I don&#39;t know if we could have scored more. Each and every stage of the tournament we have to play our best cricket and that&#39;s what we aim to do.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Aiden Markram, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; Captian: &quot;Emotions turned quite quickly, nice for us to get over the line. Chasing 215 isn&#39;t easy, and the guys contributed well to chase a big target. We knew in a quick outfield like this we&#39;ll score more than expected, but we had to be aggressive. Abhishek started up off, and then Tripathi gave him company. Those cameos from Phillips and Klaasen were crucial. I think you got to train it and put yourself under pressure.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Glenn Phillips is the Player of the Match</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">Glenn Phillips: &quot;It was a situation where it was going to go one of two ways. Happy to get out on top of this one. We are all here to do our job, this is what the team needed today. Fantastic for it to pay off, and I had so much fun today out there. I was disappointed the actual slot ball didn&#39;t go over the fence. I felt I left a lot out there with 17 needed off the final over, but then Samad did what he did and obviously we got that little bit of luck with the no ball.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n",

The Defending Champions have been the most consistent team this year and thus find themselves at the top of the points table with 7 wins from their 10 matches so far. The top order consisting of Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha, and Hardik Pandya has been firing while the likes of David Miller, Abhinav Manohar, and Rahul Tewatia add that much-needed depth to the batting lineup. Mohammad Shami and Rashid Khan have looked after the bowling department and are second and third on the list of highest wicket-takers respectively with 18 scalps apiece. Noor Ahmed has been impressive while Mohit Sharma has looked good at the death for the Titans. GT will fancy their chances against a team that has been rather inconsistent in their recent encounters. LSG has lost 3 out of their last 5 matches. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> will miss the services of their Skipper KL Rahul who has been ruled out of the league due to an injury and Krunal Pandya will take charge in his absence. Kyle Mayers holds the key when it comes to the batting side of things. Marcus Stoinis and Nicholas Pooran will need to shoulder the responsibility in KL Rahul&#39;s absence. Spinners Amit Mishra and Ravi Bishnoi have been doing a good job of picking wickets at the same time in restricting the scoring of the opposition. The concern is the fast bowling department where only Naveen Ul Haq has been impressive and the rest have failed to have a major impact so far. Looking at the current form of LSG it will be a daunting task to end the losing streak against the table toppers at their home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Daren Ganga</strong> : &quot;This pitch has a name embellished on it, quite synonymous with India and there&#39;s a lot of grandeur inspiration out here in the middle. Straight is 74 meters, and 63 and 68 are the square boundaries. We are playing on pitch number 7 and no extremities here, just the heat. Very little grass cover and it looks a little dark brown because of the heat this surface is expected to dry out and it could turn out to be good for batting. Both spinners and pacers can be in business wickets in this venue.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head to Head:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (35)_1683453720.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> <strong>wins the toss and elects <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Krunal Pandya, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;We will bowl.

Wriddhiman Saha took charge in the powerplay and Shubman Gill replicated the same later on in the innings. The duo put together a match-winning partnership of 142 runs putting GT in the driver&#39;s seat. Saha smashed 81 at a strike rate of 188 while Gill remained unbeaten on 94 from 51.

Mayers scored 48 from 32 while QDK smashed 70 from 41 in his first appearance this season. The team lost track in the middle overs where Noor Ahmed and Rashid Khan applied breaks on LSG&#39;s scoring rate. LSG scored Only 58 runs in the middle over and lost 3 wickets. Thereafter there was very little scope for LSG to stage a comeback as the required rate went above 15 r.p.o. Mohit Sharma using his slower variations accounted for four wickets for just 29 runs.

I feel Rashid Khan&#39;s catch was a game-changer, until then it was even Stevens. We were both driving at 100kph as a team but that catch caused a bump in their chase. (When asked about Krunal Pandya) My love towards him is very strong, &nbsp;It would have been nice if it was a little tighter and we had won, he could have also had some bragging rights.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shubman Gill is Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shubman Gill: &quot;: They were going quite well in the powerplay but our bowlers came back really well especially Mohit bhai. It&#39;s an honor to be able to share his Saha experience, I stand next to him at first slip, it is phenomenal with the way he keeps going, he&#39;s been playing since the first edition. I didn&#39;t get much of a strike in the first few overs but it is important to not get carried away with what your partner is doing. I had not hit sixes in the last two matches and today I struck a few, I always keep working on my skills.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The dew took the spinners out of the game, but credit to the Delhi batters as well. We felt like 185 was a par score and we needed one big over that could take us to 200, that would have made a difference. I was really pleased to see Lomror at 5 and he played really well.

But the way we came out led by Phil Salt paved the way. Our intention was to take on Siraj, he&#39;s been bowling well and taking wickets early, his wickets have been bowled or LBW so we wanted to drag his length back. Credit to the way the bowlers bowled, Anrich is not there but Ishant is leading the pack with Khaleel, and Kuldeep and Axar as well have been brilliant. It is all about momentum, we are finding the right balance at the right time. Now we go to Chennai and try to get a performance there.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Phil Salt is the Player of the Match</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Phil Salt:</strong> &quot;We spoke before the game about being positive. We knew the wicket was slow and low, and we spoke about playing off the back foot. I thought 180 was par, I felt we would have to bat really well to get there. Loving the support, especially here in Delhi.&quot;</span></p>\n",

All eyes are on today&#39;s game for the excitement it brings and also considering the points table. The winner of today&#39;s match will comfortably climb to number two. Mumbai have played nine and has won five matches out of them while CSK has also won five but are one ahead in the number of matches and in the points (One point for the rain-affected game). When the last time these two giants met, the Chennai boys claimed victory quite comfortably chasing the target. But here at Chepauk, the records favor Mumbai Indians against the home team. The whistles will blow loud undoubtedly but can the PALTANS continue their supremacy here?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head to Head:-</strong><br />\nThe rivalry has taken place on 35 occasions and the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> are leading the tally with 20 victories and&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> have 15 wins.

Last few games the results have not gone in our favour and so it is good to be back on the winning side. I was doubtful about the decision at the toss. I wanted to bat first but the think tank thought about the rain, and I was slightly outnumbered, so we went with the majority. If there is some kind of confusion then we sit and talk about it. Bowlers who don&#39;t have a very clean action are difficult to pick, it is not the pace or variations, but the consistency. I would prefer Pathirana not to play red-ball cricket and play all the ICC tournaments, he would be a great asset for Sri Lanka.&quot;</span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Matheesha Pathirana is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Matheesha Pathirana:</strong> &quot;My journey with CSK started last year.

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Two teams that have carried on their form from the previous season and have not disappointed their fans are <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />. The two teams are placed in the top 4 on the points table because of their consistent performance so far. GT who are the table toppers have won 6 out of their 9 matches while RR has clinched 5 out of their 9 games this year. Although the Royals have lost 3 out of their last 4 encounters, they will still fancy their chances against a team that has already been defeated by them once this year. Yashasvi Jaiswal has been the key player when it comes to RR&#39;s batting and also occupies the second spot in the race for the orange cap with 428 runs at an average of nearly 48. Skipper Sanju Samson and Jos Buttler&#39;s form has dipped in the last few games but it is a matter of one shot that these talented batters find their rhythm again. Sandeep Sharma and Trent Boult in charge of the pace attack have done well while the spin attack is world-class, to say the least. It will be an interesting battle between RR spinners and GT middle order that has the likes of Vijay Shankar and Hardik Pandya who are good players of spin. Shubman Gill at the top is GT&#39;s top scorer while the likes of Abhinav Manohar and Rahul Tewatia have been able to strike lusty blows whenever opportunity arises. A good game of Cricket awaits at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium between two top sides who are most likely to make it to the playoffs this season.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (32)_1683295883.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>KEY BATTLES TO WATCH OUT FOR<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />:</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>JOS BUTTLER</strong></span><span style=\"color:#6600cc\"><strong> </strong></span><span style=\"color:#ff9900\"><strong>VS</strong></span><span style=\"color:#6600cc\"><strong> </strong></span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>MOHAMMAD SHAMI</strong></span>&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#000000\">&amp;</span>&nbsp; <strong><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\">SANJU SAMSON</span><span style=\"color:#ff9900\"> VS </span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">RASHID KHAN</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (10)_1683295954.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nDeep Dasgupta and &nbsp;Nick Knight: &quot;The square boundaries are 63m and 68m while it is 78m straight down the ground.

Samson was looking good but could manage only 30 before losing his wicket to Josh Little. RR kept losing wickets at regular intervals and there was no other batter to cross even the 15-run mark. Credit should be given to the Afghan Spin duo of Rashid Khan &amp; Noor Ahmed that managed to pick 5 wickets for just 39 runs in 7 overs between them. While chasing a meager total of 118 Shubman Gill and Wriddhiman Saha got GT off to a solid start going at 8.1 r.p.o in the powerplay. A 71-run stand put GT in the driver&#39;s seat and left very little scope for RR to stage a comeback. Hardik Pandya coming in at number 3 meant business from ball one and looked in some hurry to get done with the game.

I feel Wriddhiman Saha is one of the best Keepers in the World, not easy to pick Rashid Khan and Noor Ahmed with the speeds at which they operate. I made some judgment errors in the last game, but today my job was half done by the time Shubman Gill got out.

Sometimes I lose my line&nbsp;&amp; length, but I know that the batters will face problems once I get my line and length straight. I bowled a few bad balls and was penalized.

Both the teams have had a similar run so far winning just 3 matches this season. The Home Team Sunrisers are coming into the game on the back of a win against the Delhi Capitals in their previous encounter. The Orange Army is a competent Unit on paper but has not replicated the same in their performances. Mayank Markande has been impressive so far, the leggie has scalped 10 in 6 games. Aiden Markram and Co. have been struggling to find the right combination and the same can be seen from the number of changes they have made to their batting order and side. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> on the other side have not done well either but will be looking to bounce back to winning ways on a track where there is assistance for Spinners. KKR&#39;s Spin trio can be expected to play a vital role today. Nitish Rana-led KKR have some tremendous talent in the side but have been patchy is their performances. The side has failed to click as a unit and would look to avenge the loss suffered against SRH in the first leg Clash in the league. Although both sides are lying at the bottom of the points table, it is not all over for any side and a win here can very well spark a change in their fortunes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (31)_1683208149.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions : </strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (9)_1683208224.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nDaren Ganga: &quot;&#39;We are playing on pitch number 2 today and the dimensions are quite different.

The hosts have been displaying positive intent this season and have won 5 out of their 9 clashes. They are coming off an impressive win against CSK in a last-ball thriller at Chepauk. The Openers Shikhar Dhawan and Prabhsimran have been able to provide starts while the middle order consisting of Atahrva Taide, Liam Livingstone and Jitesh Sharma have looked promising in the last few games. Raza and Sam Curran provide balance in both the departments which gives that extra cushion to the Skipper to play with.

Cam Green and Tilak Varma have been making vital contributions while Tim David was able to showcase his power-hitting prowess in the previous encounter against RR where the big man smashed 45 runs in just 14 balls. MI&#39;s spin department is in the safe hands of Piyush Chawla but the pace bowling remains a concern as none of the pacers has had any impact so far in the tournament.

It&#39;s the same surface that was used in match 27 for PBKS vs RCB. There is some good cover of grass on the pitch, but there are some bad patches too, so it might be two-paced.

PBKS hoisted a big total on the board courtesy of some brilliant batting from Liam Livingstone and Jitesh Sharma. The duo put together 119 runs from just 52 balls with the Englishman scoring an unbeaten 82(42). Only Piyush Chawla delivered with the ball for MI picking 2 wickets for just 29 runs. Chasing 215 under lights was never going to be easy, especially after losing Rohit Sharma in the first innings of the run chase. But Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav had different plans in mind. The duo started the counter-attack and PBKS bowlers had no answers to their onslaught. Ishan Kishan&#39;s 75 from 41 and Suryakumar Yadav&#39;s 66 at a strike rate of 212 put <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> in the driver&#39;s seat and gave very little scope to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> to stage a comeback.

The average score is around 180 this IPL. Just shows where the game has reached. Ishan Kishan and SKY batted brilliantly in the middle overs. Before the start of the tournament, we had a chat as to how we wanted to play our cricket. Not to think of the results. We want to go out there and just express ourselves. You will win one and lose one. Ishan Kishan has been working really hard for the last couple of weeks. He does pack a punch. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t say conceding 200+ is a worrying factor but three to four games we have conceded more than 200.&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ishan Kishan is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Ishan Kishan: &quot; The wicket was good for batting, I kept for 20 overs and knew how it was playing.

I think it doesn&#39;t matter much when you are chasing 215. Last game we did well and finished in the last over. I try to finish it as soon as possible. Happy with my performance.

Both the teams are placed in the top half of the points table having done reasonably well. But the recent outings for both sides have been unsuccessful ones. The hosts will look to exploit the home conditions better as the earlier home games haven&#39;t been so fruitful. Kyle Mayers is the key in the batting order especially in the absence of KL Rahul who is ruled out of this match due to an injury sustained in the previous game. Nicholas Pooran and Marcus Stoinis have been consistent and would be expected to come good against a tough opponent in CSK. Spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Amit Mishra will be crucial at Ekana where the track is relatively slow &amp; low. Their task will be cut out against a top CSK batting unit that is in good form. Devon Conway is the top run-getter with 5 half-centuries already. Ruturaj Gaikwad has complimented him well from the other end. The middle order of Shivam Dube and Ravindra Jadeja has done a good job too in keeping up the tempo set by the openers. MSD, Moeen Ali, and Ravindra Jadeja add a lot of depth making the batting order look formidable. CSK have a lot of spin options that are good enough to take advantage of the conditions that might just suit them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (29)_1683109369.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions </strong>:</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (7)_1683109448.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nDanny Morrison &amp; Aarn Finch: &quot;Only 61 meters on one side &amp; the other side is 75 meters.

The hosts have carried on with their last year&#39;s form winning 6 out of their 8 games. All the departments have fired and every player is contributing to the team&#39;s Success. Shubman Gill at the top is the highest run-getter for GT while Rashid Khan and Mohammad Shami are in the top five wicket-takers list so far. The middle order consisting of Vijay Shankar, Abhinav Manohar, David Miller and Rahul Tewatia has been delivering whenever opportunity arises. The home team are the clear favorites against their opponent DC which is last on the points table. The visitors have won just 2 games out of their 8 and have been struggling to find the right balance. David Warner is scoring runs but the likes of Shaw and Manish Pandey have not had any major impact this year. Mitchell Marsh and Phil Salt need to get runs if DC wants to post a big score on the board. DC spinners Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav have done a fair job but the pacers have been leaking runs. Anrich Nortje and Mukesh Kumar&#39;s bowling will be tested by a GT batting unit that has been batting with attacking intent from top to bottom. It will be a daunting task for the visitors to defeat the table toppers in their own backyard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (28)_1683037388.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nNick Knight.: &quot;It might rain a little but at this moment it is dry and fine. The third time the same pitch is being used and most likely the final will be played on this strip as well. There is a nice covering of grass but it&rsquo;s chopped down a little bit. As per the Groundsman, it&#39;s a little bit drier this time around partly because we are expecting a bit of rain and when they put the covers on, they don&rsquo;t want this to be too moist. There will be a bit of cracks in patches. If you are getting a total of 180-190, you have a good chance to win.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong><br />\n4 IPL MATCHES IN 2023 AT AHMEDABAD:&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST: 1<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND : 3<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 192</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>TOSS:-<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> <strong>wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/gt dC_1683037487.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>David Warner, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We will bat.

We were slow to get off the blocks, but Rahul Tewatia got us back in the game like he always does. I tried my best in the end but it was not to be. I and Abhinav Manohar were hoping to get a couple of big overs in the middle but we couldn&rsquo;t get going. It was not easy for Abhinav as well and it boils down to how I could not finish the game. Full marks to the bowlers and full ownership I couldn&rsquo;t finish it. Shami was brilliant and made the ball talk but feel bad for him that we end up on the losing side&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>David Warner, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; Our bowlers were simply amazing. Our batters struggled but credit goes to the way Mohd. Shami delivered. We just find ways to lose wickets in clusters, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the issue with our batting. We tried playing positively today but failed. We wanted to come out and swing the ball, and get early wickets. Khaleel did well after coming back from injury, and Ishant is forever getting younger.

Kyle Mayers has been in sensational form scoring 4 fifties in 8 games while Skipper KL Rahul has been playing second fiddle pretty well. The middle order looks formidable in the presence of Nicholas Pooran, Marcus Stoinis, and Ayush Badoni who have looked destructive, to say the least. The bowling unit comprising Avesh Khan, Yash Thakur, Naveen Ul Haq, and Ravi Bishnoi has done a reasonable job for the supergiants. They will look to make early inroads in the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> batting line up which is top-heavy so far. Virat Kohli and Faf have scored 10 half-centuries between them while Glenn Maxwell has shown that he can take apart any bowling unit in a matter of few overs. The concern is their middle order which has failed to get going and end the innings with a flourish. Siraj is the spearhead with the ball and has done a remarkable job in keeping the opposition quiet but other bowlers have been inconsistent in their performances. RCB would want to avenge the previous loss in their own backyard against LSG and settle scores while LSG would focus on continuing the winning momentum that they gained in their previous encounter scoring the second all-time highest score.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>VENUE STATS:<br />\nIPL 2023 AT LUCKNOW:&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST: 2<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND: 2<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 152</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (27)_1682949501.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (6)_1682949769.png\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nSanjay Manjrekar and Rohan Gavaskar: &quot;The square boundaries are 72 metres and 63 metres.

We played really well in the first six overs and got a steady start. To have a fifty partnership in the six overs was match-changing. It was a good toss to win and batting first was important. Playing spinners here was always going to be difficult.

Rajasthan got off to a flying start courtesy of Yashasvi Jaiswal who was on the charge from ball one. The score in powerplay was 65 at no loss. Jaiswal carried the onslaught till the 20th over scoring his maiden IPL Century. Piyush Chawla and Kumar Kartikeya bowled economically in the context of the game. Chasing 212 was never an easy task, especially after losing the wicket of the Skipper early in the innings. Cameron Green led the counterattack for MI alongside Ishan Kishan who played second fiddle in a 62-run stand. Just when the run rate was increasing, Suryakumar Yadav unleashed his hitting prowess and kept MI in the game. The momentum tilted to MI in the 13th Over when SKY smashed 20 runs off it. It took a stunning catch from Sandeep Sharma to dismiss an on-song Suryakumar Yadav. With 57 needed off four overs, Tim David showed the World what he is capable of and finished things in style by smashing three sixes in the last over.

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>The action moves to MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai where the Super Kings will play host to the Kings from Punjab. The hosts have been consistent so far having lost only 3 games out of their 8. They are placed well in the top four in the points table and are very likely to make the playoffs. Devon Conway is a major reason behind CSK&#39;s success while he is very well supported by Ruturaj Gaikwad from the other end. The middle order of Rahane and Dube has been in sensational form while Jadeja provides that depth in both batting and bowling. The Left arm orthodox has been able to pick crucial wickets at a meager economy. The fast bowling unit which has leaked runs is the only concern for Skipper MSD. Dhawan and Co. at the other end have been very inconsistent and find themselves in the bottom half of the table. Atharva Taide and Jitesh Sharma have been impressive while the Skipper is back in the side, the batting looks formidable. Liam Livingstone is a player to watch out for and would be expected to have an impact if <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> wants to get past <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> at their fortress.

The openers put together an 86-run stand for the first wicket. Shivam Dube at No.3 managed to strike some lusty blows too. Conway&#39;s 92 at a strike rate of 177 made sure that CSK posts a huge total on the board. Chasing 201 was never going to be easy with the spinners in the CSK ranks. Prabhsimran Singh and Shikhar Dhawan came out all guns blazing for the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> chase. The team reached 50 in just 4.2 overs. Prabhsimran smashed 42 of just 24 balls. Liam Livingstone at no.4 did not waste any time either. Cameos from Jitesh Sharma and Sam Curran took the game deep. The 16th over which conceded 24 changed the momentum in the visitor&#39;s favour. Sikandar Raza held his nerves and took the team home by scoring three of the last delivery.

In the last few overs when we were batting, we could have gotten 10-15 runs more. The slower one did grip a bit on the surface. Our batters have been putting in runs consistently.

All three games here have been won by the chasing team, but the highest score batting first is 172.

Time for the guys to express themselves and enjoy. We lost Washi and that&#39;s a big loss for us. It&#39;s an opportunity for someone to cement a spot.

After opting to bat Sunrisers started with the initial momentum going at more than 10 rpo in the Powerplay, courtesy of some clean hitting from Abhishek Sharma, who notched up his first half-century this season, after which some clean power hitting from Heinrich Klaasen in the end helped Sunrisers score 62 runs in the final 5 overs and notch up 197/6. The Hyderabad franchise continued their momentum in the second innings as well, with Bhuvneshwar Kumar dismissing Warner in the second ball of the innings, after which Mitchell Marsh and Phil Salt scored half-centuries and notched up a 100-run partnership, but the Sunrisers Spinners pulled the momentum back picking up 4 wickets between them to restrict Delhi to just 83 runs in the last 10 overs and snap their 3-match losing streak.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>David Warner, DC Captain: &quot;We were off a bit with the ball, but I think Marsh bowled fantastic.

We needed wickets to get back in the game, the two Delhi batters were doing well and it needed a special catch from Mayank Markande. Fortunately, the ball was stopping a bit and the bowlers showed great character to execute.

Had that nice partnership with Salt but not enough to get over the line. It was all about getting the boundaries, and applying the pressure. Certainly lots of positives from today. We have been on the wrong end of a few but we do feel there is a long way to go in this tournament. Time to start winning a few.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The Knights from Eden got off to a quick start in the Powerplay scoring at more than 10 rpo after fireworks from Rahmanullah Gurbaz - who scored his second IPL fifty in the process, after which the Gujarat Titans pulled back the momentum in the middle from some fine bowling by Joshua Little, but the birthday boy Andre Russell powered Kolkata in the death to end the innings on 179.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>In the chase, Shubman Gill gave Gujarat a good start falling just 1 run short of his half-century but the Kolkata spinners pulled things back in the middle and pushed the required run rate to more than 11 rpo, but a finishing masterclass from Vijay Shankar and David Miller ensured that the Gujarat Titans get across the finish line with 13 balls to spare and move to the top of the table&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/medal.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1682784580.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Nitish Rana, KKR Captain: &quot;I think we were 20-25 runs short.

Everyone in the group knows that we would have to play good cricket to win the game, and that&#39;s the humbleness that has kept us in good stead. It&#39;s all about playing good cricket consistently, irrespective of a win or a loss. Vijay Shankar is fitter, and more confident and the amount of hard work he&#39;s done is terrific.

The hosts will be happy with the performance against MI in their previous encounter at home and would want to continue the winning momentum at home. Shikhar&#39;s Dhawan participation still remains a concern but the other batters did step up in the last game. Harpreet Bhatia and Sam Curran looked solid in the middle order while Jitesh Sharma has taken up the responsibility of a finisher for PBKS. One can never underestimate the side in the presence of the likes of Liam Livingstone in the ranks. Arshdeep has been phenomenal especially at the death while Nathan Ellis has complimented him well from the other end. The visitors have the depth in the side in both departments but have been inconsistent in their last few outings.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> had a day to forget against GT where they were in control of the game but gave it away in the last four overs. Skipper KL Rahul and Kyle Mayers have been amongst the runs but the middle order has lacked luster in their performances. Avesh Khan, Krunal Pandya, and Marcus Stoinis have failed to register noteworthy performances while Naveen UL Haq has bowled well but has not had any success in terms of wickets. It will be interesting to see LSG&#39;s approach against the Punjab Kings as they have already tasted defeat against them in the first leg of IPL 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>VENUE STATS:<br />\nIPL 2023 AT MOHALI:&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST: 2<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND: 1<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL : 173<br />\nHIGHEST 1ST INN SCORE: 191<br />\nHIGHEST SUCCESSFUL CHASE: 154</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (22)_1682690324.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions : </strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (2)_1682690426.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nSamuel Badree: &quot; We are at Pitch No. 3. There are larger sides 75m and 67m, straight hit is 73m. The surface looks like a belter of a track. Nice covering of grass too. It seems compact and hard and that suggests to me the ball will come on nicely onto the bat. The Average first innings score in Mohali is 173, but on this pitch, PBKS scored 191 vs KKR in the only game they have won at home. So the team batting first will be aiming 200 with the dew factor later on.

Mayers smashed 54 from 24 while Badoni who was promoted up the order added 43 from 24 balls. The middle order was in a similar mood as Stoinis and Pooran wasted no time and kept the tempo high. Stoinis added 70 (40) while Pooran made 45 at a destructive strike rate of 236. Rahul Chahar was the only bowler who conceded less than 8 r.p.o. It was never going to be easy chasing almost 13 r.p.o, especially after losing openers early in the powerplay. But Atharva Taide making his maiden IPL half-century impressed everyone with his valiant effort. All the batters in the middle order played fine cameos but the asking rate proved to be just a lot at the end. Naveen ul Haq picking 3 wickets for just 30 runs in his four overs was the pick of the bowlers for LSG.

Every game from now on is very important. We came back fresher after a break. We were clear as to how to bat. When you see such wickets, you get excited as batters.

The team possesses all the capabilities to turn to winning ways as most of the players have looked in good knick of things. Jos Buttler and Yashasvi Jaiswal have been good at the top while Skipper Sanju Samson and Shimron Hetmyer in the middle order have made some vital contributions. RR has arguably the best bowling attack in the presence of World Class spinners like Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravi Ashwin. Trent Boult and Sandeep Sharma have been taking care of the pace attack. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> on the other side are coming off in the game after three wins on the trot but will be on their guard as their last loss came against the very same opponent. It will be a contest between RR&#39;s bowling and CSK&#39;s batting arsenal, likes of Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway who have been in sensational form will be tested by the swing duo of Sandeep Sharma and Trent Boult while the middle-order comprising of Ajinkya Rahane and Shivam Dube will have to tackle the RR spinners. While All-rounder Ravindra Jadeja has been in sensational form Skipper MSD has managed to marshall the troop of young pacers pretty well so far. It will be interesting to see what the yellow army does differently in order to avenge their last loss at home.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\n<strong>Chennai and Rajasthan have encountered 27 times in IPL. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />has won <span style=\"color:#000000\">15 </span>whereas <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;have come out victorious on 12 occasions.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (21)_1682602897.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nDarren Ganga and Kevin Pietersen: &quot; It is pitch number 5 and it will impact the boundary sizes as well.

But the big change this evening is the even covering of grass. That is not to say it is going to be bouncing everywhere and seaming everywhere, it may start a little bit like that, however, I think the batters are going to turn up this evening and think this is way better for batting, 154 may not be enough this evening.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions : </strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel (1)_1682602970.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1682604632.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Sanju Samson, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;We will bat first.

This is the second time that the two teams will be locking horns in this year&#39;s IPL. Although the first encounter went KKR&#39;s way, RCB is a much-improved unit now. Also, the fact that KKR is on a 4 match-losing streak makes RCB a favorite in this contest. The home side has a top order which is second to none but have not been able to get those noteworthy performances from the middle order which has unfortunately not got enough time in the middle.

I am completely fine with the batter turning up here thinking &#39;let me find my way here, and it does not look like it is going to spin&quot;.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions :</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Wagon wheel_1682516825.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1682517901.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Virat Kohli, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;We will bowl first.

RCB looked destructive in the first couple of overs but a master stroke from Nitish Rana to turn to the young leg spinner in the powerplay turned the tides in KKR&#39;s favour. Suyash Sharma got the prize wicket of Faf Du Plessis in his first over and dismissed Shahbaz Ahmed in his next over. Varun Chakravarthy who has been KKR&#39;s top performer with the ball in the tournament ran through the middle RCB order. The mystery spinner scalped three which included a big wicket of Glenn Maxwell. Virat Kohli and Mahipal Lomror fought back but could not take the team home.

To be honest we handed them a victory. We were certainly not up to the standard tonight. If you look at the game, we didn&#39;t capitalize on our chances, We dropped a few chances which cost us 25-30 runs. We set up ourselves really well in the first couple of overs but lost momentum thereafter. We kept finding fielders.

You need a lot of character in the dressing room to give a performance like this in our situation. We believe in ourselves and knew that a bounce back is around the corner. Felt like the score was not enough but there was not much dew so it did help our spinners. It didn&#39;t turn a lot but we bowled well and kept it tight. Suyash Sharma is a class act, he has always put his hand up in tough situations. He always says I&#39;ll do the job.

The home team has had a good run so far, winning 4 out of their 6 encounters. The Top order comprising of Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha and Hardik Pandya has been in good knick of things. Vijay Shankar and Sai Sudarshan have contributed well to the team&#39;s cause while David Miller and Abhinav Manohar are responsible for providing firepower finish to the team. The bowling side of things seems settled in the presence of the Spin Wizard Rashid Khan who has scalped 12 wickets so far. Mohammad Shami has found his rhythm and has bowled economically. But the defending Champions would not want to take things lightly against the five-time champions Mumbai Indians. MI has clinched three and lost three so far. Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav and Cameron Green getting runs in the previous encounter will boost MI&#39;s confidence against GT in the away fixture. The concern for MI remains their Bowling department which has not found the right balance as yet. Jofra Archer has failed to have any noteworthy performance while Behrendorff and Arjun Tendulkar have been on the expensive side. MI&#39;s only bowler that has created problems for the opposition is Piyush Chawla, it will be interesting to see his tactics on a track that is more suited to pace bowling.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (18)_1682431568.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Deep Dasgupta and Matthew Hayden</strong>: &quot; The highest number of sixes on an average has been struck at this venue along with Eden Gardens.

Even though it&#39;s red soil, the bounce will be traditional, and also grip a bit due to the presence of moisture in the soil&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\nIPL 2023 AT AHMEDABAD:&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST : 0<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;SECOND : 3<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 186</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> <strong>wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1682431805.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We are gonna field first.

SRH have been the most inconsistent side this year especially keeping in mind the strength they possess on paper. Likes of Aiden Markram, Mayank Agarwal and Rahul Tripathi have not turned up with the bat while their most expensive buy Harry Brook has just fired in one inning so far. The bowling unit that comprises Marco Jansen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umran Malik and T Natarajan is second to none but has not had any major impact so far. Mayank Markande is only positive when it comes to their bowling department is concerned. The visitors have failed to find the right balance and have been struggling so far, barring the previous encounter where the team clinched the game in the last over. David Warner is the lone wolf with the bat and would need the likes of Shaw, Pandey and Marsh to fire. Ishant Sharma making his come back looked in his element while Anrich Nortje at the other end is bowling with some serious pace. The spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel has been able to curb the scoring rate and would be expected to play a big role against an SRH batting order that has a lot of Right Handers in their ranks.

The home team has failed to find the right balance and thus finds itself in the bottom half of the points table. There have been a few good individual performances from the likes of Skipper Nitish Rana, Rinku Singh, Venkatesh Iyer, and Shardul Thakur but the team has not found a single consistent performer in the batting department. Spinners Varun Chakravarthy and Sunil Narine have fared well but have lacked support from the pace attack of KKR. They will definitely have their task cut out against a strong CSK batting order. Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway have been instrumental in CSK&#39;s success so far while the middle order too has made contributions. Having an All-rounder like Ravindra Jadeja makes the job of any captain easy. The all-rounder has been in superb form with the ball so far. MSD has led his arsenal of young pacers well and thus we see the likes of Tushar Deshpande, Akash Singh, and Matheesha Pathirana delivering in tough situations. KKR would need to play out of their skin to get past a CSK unit that is brimming with confidence!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nDarren Ganga: &quot; It&#39;s pitch number 4 being used. Square boundaries - 56 metres and 70 metres, straight - 70 metres. The pitch looks very good for batting, it&#39;s very typical of an Eden Gardens pitch. There&#39;s a tinge of green, the grass is even, so I expect a consistent bounce and consistent pace. What we&#39;ve seen here is of course seamers dominate with wicket-taking, spinners a little more economical. The trend is to opt to chase. But if you score in excess of 200, you give yourself a very good chance of winning.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (16)_1682255353.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Nitish Rana, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />Skipper: &quot; Would like to bowl first.

RR has been the most consistent side this year and find itself at the top of the points table. The Openers Jaiswal and Buttler have been in good form and have provided flying starts in most innings. Sanju Samson has been striking the ball well too. The form of Devdutt Padikkal in the middle order remains a concern but the left-hander seems just one innings away to get back to his own. The bowling side of things seems settled with Yuzvendra Chahal doing the most damage and other complimenting him well. The leg spinner also enjoys bowling at the venue and will fancy his chance against his former teammates. Virat Kohli and Co. have been top-heavy this year as well. The bulk of the balls have been faced by Faf, Virat and Maxwell and has done a tremendous job in most games. But the concern here is the exposure the middle order has not received in that process. Dinesh Karthik, Mahipal Lomror, and Shahbaz Ahmed have not got enough game time in the middle as yet. Mohammad Siraj has been brilliant with the new ball while other have been expensive. Although Wanindu Hasaranga&#39;s inclusion will add that balance the team requires in all the departments. It will be interesting to see the lineups of the teams considering it&#39;s a day game at this venue which has a lot of runs on offer.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nPommie Mbangwa and Aaron Finch.: &quot; It will be tough work in the field as it is a day game at the Chinnaswamy. We are at the center pitch today, so 62m and 63m are the side boundaries. The straight boundary is 67m, so not a big hit anywhere on this ground. The surface looks dry and being a day game, the average first innings score in 158. it is a slower surface and might turn. The powerplay is so much more important on drier surfaces, as you have to get the most runs. You need to take a few chances early on. As a bowler, the best strategy is to vary your lengths and use slower balls. Doesn&#39;t matter if you bat first or bat second&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (15)_1682244043.png\" style=\"width:640px\" />&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> wins the toss and elects to field first!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1682244329.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Sanju Samson, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We&#39;ll bowl first.

Virat Kohli was out in the first over and Shahbaz Ahmed followed soon. It was a partnership between Faf and Maxwell that swung the momentum in RCB&#39;s favor! Maxwell&#39;s 77(44) and Faf&#39;s 62(39) dismantled the RR bowling attack which had no reply to the onslaught. But some brilliance in the field from Jaiswal to get the wicket of Faf Du Plessis changed the course of the game.

RR came back strongly restricting RCB for just 189. In response, RR lost Buttler early but Jaiswal and Padikkal made sure to keep up with the asking rate. Just when RR was cruising along, a spell from Harshal Patel changed the entire complexion of the game. The bowler using his bag of tricks scalped three wickets at a crucial juncture which made things tough for RR. Patel finished with figures of 32/3 from is four while David Willey played his part by being economical in his four-over spell.

It is about getting the momentum right, normally, Hetmyer does it for us but he had an off-day today, one shot here and there does it for us. The thought keeps on changing, depending on how the wicket plays, we decide on the time when a wicket falls. With the IPL games, winnings and losings are done in very small margins, keep checking small boxes, we need to keep on checking all those.

The pitch looked dry and I mentioned to the guys that they will have 10 overs under lights which is very difficult out here. The advantage was the ball got scuffed up. However, with the impact player rule and the extra batter, games are always on. That&#39;s why so many close games. The counter-attack from Maxi and Faf was even better than the Chennai game, it was a better surface that day. Maxi took the game away in just four overs. Harshal Patel always bowls the tough overs, not easy at Chinnaswamy. He&#39;s closed out games against DC and today as well. So massive credit to the way he has performed. We trust Him to deliver at death.

The home team has made a dramatic turnaround like always, winning three games after losing its first two encounters. MI although misses the services of its premium pacers Jasprit Bumrah and Jofra Archer, has managed to do well with the available resources. Behrendorff has looked good while Arjun Tendulkar has made a good start to his IPL career. Piyush Chawla has been the stand-out performer with the ball with 7 wickets against his name. Skipper Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan have taken the team off to good starts in their previous two encounters while Tilak Varma has been their highest run-getter. With Cameron Green getting some runs in the previous game, this MI batting unit looks formidable, to say the least. PBKS on the other side has not been consistent in the tournament. Out of the 6 games, they have won 3 and lost 3. The team has some big names but has failed to live up to the expectations so far. Liam Livingstone would be expected to come well if the team wants to get past a strong MI unit at their fortress. Arshdeep Singh has been in good form while Sam Curran and Nathan Ellis have complimented him well. While Shikhar Dhawan&#39;s injury is the concern, it will be interesting to see PBKS&#39; tactics in the next game considering the impact player rule!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (14)_1682167227.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\nMatthew Hayden and Danny Morrison: &quot; It is not the biggest ground going around; 65 meters on one side and 59 on the other, downtown 75.

The home team is coming off a win in a low-scoring encounter against RR which is currently topping the table. The credit goes to the bowlers Avesh Khan, Naveen Ul Haq, Marcus Stoinis, and the spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Amit Mishra. The Opening pair of Skipper KL Rahul and Kyle Mayers has done well so far and provided the vital starts to the side. But their mettle will be tested by the Likes of Mohammad Shami and Rashid Khan who have been in remarkable form with the ball. GT batting that starts with Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha and Sai Sudarshan looks solid. With Hardik Pandya, David Miller, and Abhinav Manohar in the middle order, the side possesses the ability to chase down any total on board.

We are a champion side, we won last year. You have to be satisfied with your results. The spirit and the atmosphere changed after getting wickets, that&#39;s a very great feeling. A win like this can boost your confidence. I think the way the wicket was playing, we could have got 10 runs more. There was uncertainty. They bowled well and made our life difficult. The batters couldn&#39;t get rhythm because of the wicket. During the strategic timeout, we spoke about the set batter going for it toward the end. We were always chasing them, and never in it. When they needed 30 runs in 30 balls, I thought they were ahead. But when they required 27 in 4 overs, I thought they were under pressure. That&#39;s where I thought we could be in the game. The way every bowler contributed, as a captain I couldn&#39;t have asked for more.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2c3e50\"><strong>Mohit Sharma is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#4e5f70\"><strong>&quot;Nothing special, everything&#39;s normal, as usual.

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>The next clash in IPL 2023 is between the Chennai Super Kings and the Sunrisers from Hyderabad. &nbsp;The hosts CSK have started well this year and are placed in the top 4 on the points table with 3 wins from their 5 games so far. The openers Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway have been among the runs while Rahane and Shivam Dube have also contributed to the team&#39;s cause. MSD has been able to strike some lusty blows whenever the opportunity arises. Looking at the bowling side of things Tushar Deshpande is the top wicket-taker but has leaked runs while spinners Moeen Ali and Jadeja have been able to curb the scoring rate of the opposition.</p>\n\n<p>The home team would be confident going into the encounter against a team that has a very dismal record at the venue. SRH has one of the best sides on paper but has failed to replicate the same in its performances. Harry Brook scored a ton but has looked out of sorts in other games. Mayank Agarwal and Aiden Markram have not looked in their element so far. SRH possesses a bowling arsenal that can get past any batting unit. Skipper Aiden Markram will bank on the Likes of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Marco Jansen, Umran Malik, and T Natarajan to come good against an in-form CSK batting unit. Not to forget Mayank Markande who has been doing well and can come in handy at Chepauk which is more suited to spin bowling.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:-</strong></p>\n\n<p>The head-to-head record between the two teams is heavily in favor of the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />.

We have seen that with Malinga, someone who has an awkward actions and who is very consistent with line and length. It&#39;s difficult to score off him. I was hesitant to bat second. Had the feeling there won&#39;t be much dew. Overall the middle overs were the setup. Fast bowlers bowled very well in the last few overs. I always tell them that the first preference of field setting is with you. Still, they didn&#39;t give me the best catch. I felt it was a fantastic catch.

Glenn Maxwell has found his form and looked unstoppable against CSK in their [previous encounter where the Aussie smashed 76 runs at a strike rate of 211. Dinesh Karthik who is in charge of providing a firepower finish too got some runs under his belt.

We&#39;re playing on pitch 4, this is a new pitch and the dimensions are pretty even. 70m on both sides and 75m on the straight boundary. Yesterday&#39;s rain has meant that the pitch hasn&#39;t been watered too much and that means the pitch is slightly dry. But there are plenty of runs on this surface and the spinners could come into the game later on&quot;.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\nIPL MATCHES AT MOHALI SINCE 2018 :&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST: 5<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND: 7<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 175<br />\nAVG 1ST INN WIN SCORE: 186</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> have clashed 30 times in IPL.

Once again it was the opening pair of Faf Du Plessis and Virat Kohli that did all the scoring for the Challengers taking the team total to 174 on a sluggish wicket. In response, PBKS lost 4 wickets in the powerplay and could not find a way back into the game. Prabhsimran Singh was going at a brisk rate from one end but kept losing partners at the other end. It was Jitesh Sharma who came in at No.7 that brought the Kings back in the game but the task was a little out of hand as he too lacked support from the other end. Prabhsimran scored 46(30) while Jitesh Sharma got 41(27). Mohammad Siraj was simply superb with the new ball and also at the death.

It&#39;s towards game 13 or 14 we can try and focus on what we need to do. Faf batted really well on that pitch. His innings ensured we had that 20-30 extra at the end. The pitch was very rough underneath, there was not enough water there I guess. There were hardly any sixes hit off the back foot against the spinners. The strategy was to bat deep to have a crack at 190. Told them (the bowlers) that the target was more than enough. Cannot afford to take the game deep, especially when they lost 6-7 wickets. The batting lineups are deeper, but we also have options in our bowling. At the halfway stage, the talk was to take the game to the opposition and you kind of break the game open when you pick up 4 wickets in the powerplay.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Mohammad Siraj is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000000\"><strong>Mohammad Siraj: &quot;First ball the length was a bit short and then I sensed the need to bowl full to get some swing and that was the plan for the first wicket.

Jos Buttler has been the top scorer for RR providing those vital starts in the powerplay while Shimron Hetmyer has taken up the responsibility of finishing things with a flourish. Captain Sanju Samson has also been amongst the runs striking at 165 in the middle overs. The bowling unit comprising Yuzi Chahal, R Ashwin, and Trent Boult possesses the ability to get past any batting unit on any given track. The leg spinner is also the joint-highest wicket-taker having 11 against his name. He shares the spot with Mark Wood who has been lethal for the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> with his express pace. Ravi Bishnoi and Krunal Pandya have managed to keep things tight also, chipping in with few wickets. Kyle Mayers is the top performer with the bat but has looked a little out of sorts in the previous two games. One can expect Quinton De Kock to feature in the game in place of Mayers. Skipper KL Rahul has been doing the scoring but has failed to do so at a brisk rate whereas Nicholas Pooran in the middle order makes up for the same with his hitting prowess towards the end. The southpaw is batting at a staggering strike rate of 216 in this year&#39;s IPL. A contest more like a game of Chess between two well-balanced sides awaits at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.

A pretty substantial breeze that&#39;s blowing across, might come into play. This is not a dead-center pitch on this ground. The square boundary is just 62m and 68m on the other side, but the straight boundary is 70 and upwards 78m. If you&#39;re going to hit straight, make sure you&#39;ve got a lot of power behind the shot. So there&#39;s an incentive to play cross-batted on this pitch. I find this pitch on the harder side. It might be a little bit two-paced as well&quot;.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Sanju Samson, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We are going to bowl first.

Both the teams have had a similar run so far having won two out of their four fixtures so far. Mumbai and SRH both lost their first two games but came back strongly in the next two. SRH have one of the best teams this season in terms of their balance and the same was seen in their previous fixture against KKR. Their most expensive buy Harry Brook showed his mettle by scoring his maiden IPL Century and their Skipper Aiden Markram too looked in good form. The Pace bowling Unit consists of some good bowlers like Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Marco Jansen, Umran Malik, and T Natarajan who can give be lethal on their day and the spinners Mayank Markande and Washington Sundar too have managed to keep things tight. But they have a daunting task up their sleeve as they square off against a batting unit that looked in their elements in the previous game. Rohit Sharma and Ishan Kishan provided a good start while Suryakumar Yadav who is not been amongst runs got some under his belt. Mumbai bowling department still has a few concerns but Piyush Chawla bringing in his experience has done significantly well for MI. It will be interesting to see MI&#39;s combination in this all-important clash against SRH in Hyderabad.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We have come a long way, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ipl.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> completes 15 years today!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nIan Bishop: &quot; &quot;There&#39;s a slight bias to the ground. To my right the square boundaries are 63 metres, that&#39;s not a big hit, players can muscle that. A little bit bigger to my left which is 68 metres. Down the ground about 73 metres. The outfield is pristine and it&#39;s absolutely beautiful. The surface is interesting. It&#39;s a light colour, a very grey colour. The grass that was there is cut very very low. I&#39;m just wondering if the ball feels as though it&#39;ll come on to the bat on this but because the grass is cut so low, I&#39;m not sure&quot;.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\n66 IPL MATCHES AT HYDERABAD :&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST : 28<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND : 37<br />\nTIED: 1<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 158</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />and Mumbai has clashed 19 times in IPL. &nbsp;Hyderabad has won 9 whereas<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />has come out victorious on 10 occasions.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (8)_1681830221.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:29px; width:79px\" title=\"\" /> wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1681826667.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Aiden Markram, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot; We are gonna bowl first.

Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. The home team put up a show for the home crowd in the game against DC a couple of days ago. RCB was in control of the game and were clinical in all the departments. Starting with Virat Kohli who scored his third fifty this season and the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> skipper Faf Du Plessis who has led by example in terms of pacing and innings. Maxwell has been able to provide the fire-power finish to the side while Mahipal Lomror and Shahbaz Ahmed have been making vital contributions. Looking at the bowling side of things, Mohammad Siraj has been spectacular, especially in the powerplay. Wayne Parnell fits in the side perfectly while Vyshak Vijaykumar impressed everyone on his debut at home. RCB will look to capitalize on the winning momentum against a team that is coming off a narrow defeat in their previous encounter. The responsibility to tackle the wrath of the RCB pacers will be on the shoulders of Ruturaj Gaikwad who has been CSK&#39;s top performer with the bat. Ajinkya Rahane has shown his mettle in the two games that he&#39;s been a part of. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> has done reasonably well winning two out of their four matches so far. Eyes will certainly be on MSD who has looked sensational with his power hitting at the backend of the innings. Ravindra Jadeja holds the key in the game, especially considering his record against the top two RCB batters, Virat Kohli and Faf.

That&#39;s because the leg side boundary is just 60m and the other side isn&#39;t much further at 66m. The longest hit is straight down the ground at 71m. The pitch looks very good, there is a 20-run difference between the day games and the night games. There is huge potential to get big runs today. The only concern as a batter is that the middle areas of the pitch look very dry, and it is extremely hard. From the other end though it looks like a batting paradise. How much is enough? 212 wasn&#39;t enough that day and today also it is a batting paradise&quot;.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> <strong>wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf Du Plessis, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> Skipper: &quot;Incredible noise, isn&#39;t it?

Devon Conway and Ajinkya Rahane kept playing with positive intent and made sure to lay down a foundation for the middle-order batters. But it was the partnership between Conway and Shivam Dube that put CSK in the driver&#39;s seat. Dube smashed 52 at a strike rate of 193 while Conway compiled 83 off just 45 balls. All the RCB bowlers leaked runs except Mohammad Siraj who conceded at only 7.5 r.p.o and also accounted for one crucial wicket. In response, RCB lost Virat Kohli in the first over and Mahipal Lomror in the second. But Glenn Maxwell coming to bat inside Powerplay had different plans. CSK looked helpless against the Maxwell onslaught as the Aussie went on to score 76 off just 36 balls while Faf at the other end played second fiddle scoring 62 off 33 deliveries. To add to the misery, CSK dropped four catches which almost cost them the game. CSK Spinners despite going for runs, managed to pick wickets at the right time.

It&#39;s a very long tournament, A lot of matches left and we still need to play a lot of group cricket even if we had won today. After I got out, they bowled a couple of good overs, but we should have gone a little harder and got to 200.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00cc\"><strong>Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;When you play quality opponents on a quality wicket, you get such games. Very happy to compete in such a game and come out on top. It was important to rotate our bowlers, they were playing some quality cricket and we had to respect that. The start we had, shows how good a wicket this was. The new ball and the quality of swing bowling were good and we had to respect that. Hetmyer doesn&#39;t like easy situations, and we like putting him in difficult situations because he usually wins us such situations.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00cc\"><strong>Shimron Hetmyer is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00cc\"><strong>Shimron Hetmyer:</strong></span> &quot;Difficult to win against Gujarat, they beat us thrice last year but today was sort of a revenge. I practice these situations, and it helps when you practice with that mindset of knowing we are a few wickets down and chasing 100 with 8 overs to go. Noor Ahmed bowled well throughout and all I was thinking about was getting that double and taking it from there.&quot;</p>\n",

This is the second home game for Mumbai and they would love to treat the fans with their first victory after their loss here against CSK. MI opened their account after beating Delhi Capitals last game and would look to acquire a winning streak. The visitors, KKR played four and won two out of them. Who will come out victorious today?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Suryakumar Yadav will lead the&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> side in the absence of Rohit Sharma as he is unwell!</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:22px; width:67px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:39px; width:68px\" title=\"\" /> have clashed 31 times against each other and MI are way ahead in the tally with 22 wins and KKR have got only 9 wins.

Last game we got an average score of about 180 at the Wankhede, so we are hoping for a high-scoring game. There isn&#39;t a lot of grass and some of the cracks are showing.

The management has shown faith in me and it was a very beautiful wicket to bat on. Once you score those 30-40 runs, it&#39;s just about how you continue. I think we were 15-20 runs short in the end, but given how Mumbai was going, they would&#39;ve chased it down in the next few overs anyways. If we look at their last three-four overs, they didn&#39;t give away too many runs, and credit to them.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1681657137.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n",

The Kl Rahul-led side will look to get their third consecutive win and move to the top of the table whereas their opponents Punjab Kings will look to turn the tide, after losing consecutive matches after winning their first two. <strong>Will we see another last-over thriller, in what has been a week of such events in the IPL? <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">This will also mark Deepak Hooda&#39;s 100th match in the IPL.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The two teams had played once last season and LSG had won by 20 runs in the encounter. Will Punjab level the Head to Head or will Lucknow take the win and move to the top of the table?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE REPORT:-</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lucknow has enjoyed playing at home, winning both their games and establishing their home advantage. The two matches played here this season have seen contrasting scores with, Lucknow posting 193 in the 1st innings in the first game and Sunrisers posting just 121 in the second game.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:-</strong><br />\nMatthew Hayden: &quot;It&#39;s hot but not too much wind. Short side on the leg side and the straight boundaries are the longest. This is a fresh wicket and it looks specky, with some green patches but some very dry areas. It is a red soil pitch, expect the ball to come on better on this track.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>SAM CURRAN HAS WALKED OUT FOR THE TOSS AND HE HAS CALLED IT RIGHT, AS PUNJAB WILL FIELD FIRST!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1681568031.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sam Curran, Punjab Kings Skipper: </strong></span>&quot;We&#39;ll bowl first. First toss that we have won this season. Shilkhar picked up an injury last game, don&#39;t know how bad it is but hopefully, he won&#39;t be out long. His absence is huge, we&#39;ve got two Indian batters (Atharva Taide and Harpreet Singh Bhatia) coming in and Raza is back in the XI.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;First game on this strip, it is exciting to challenge ourselves on different conditions. It is our first season here, so each game we&#39;ll assess and modify. Every game we make a few changes, settle on a 12-13 and take a call depending on the game. Everyone is enjoying the game and there is a good vibe around, really happy with the support we have got out here.&quot;</p>\n",

KL Rahul and Kyle Mayers gave Lucknow a good start in the Powerplay, with the former notching up his first half-century of the season, after which Punjab pulled back the momentum by picking up wickets in regular intervals (4 in the middle overs and 4 in the death) with the skipper Sam Curran leading from the front and picking up three wickets, to restrict Lucknow to 159/8. In the second innings, debutant Yudhvir gave Lucknow the initial momentum in the Powerplay, picking up two wickets in his first two overs, but a calm half-century from Sikandar Raza and a quickfire knock from Shahrukh Khan ensured Punjab Kings prevailed in a thriller and move into the Top 4 of the table!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We were about 10 short, the dew came in and helped the batters a bit more. When you&#39;re playing on a new pitch, you cant rely on previous games so we are taking it as it comes. If a few guys get going, we can get that 180-190 mark, but unfortunately today a few batters got caught on the boundary lines. Each player has a different role, we are 7-8 batters in our team and few are powerful enough to clear every boundary, the others have different skills. We each play our role and thats what makes the team exciting. We have power in Pooran and Stoinis, and Mayers up top takes the aggressive route. For each player taking that aggressive route can look different, you have to stick to what works best for you.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sam Curran, Punjab Kings Captain:</strong></span> &quot;Amazing win. I thought our spinners bowled nicely. Bit of dew came in but the wicket was offering a little for the bowlers. The way Sikandar Raza played was brilliant, and the way Shahrukh Khan finished it, that&#39;s what he&#39;s in our team to do. His role has been clear in our side. You go from ground to ground and have to come up with different gameplans. We&#39;ve got so many options which is lovely to have as a captain. I&#39;ve never captained before, hopefully Shikhar is fit soon.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sikandar Raza:</strong></span> &quot;Feels great to be honest. When I got out, there were a few demons in my head. Credit to Shahrukh. Nice to get a fifty but if we had lost, I wouldn&#39;t have felt so good. You&#39;re here and you want to do well.&quot;</p>\n",

The ground looks incredible, credit to the ground staff. It&#39;s about getting one win, and the momentum follows from there. We don&#39;t want to lose wickets in the powerplay. We have one change, Marsh is back and comes in for Powell.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;Would have done the same. Hopefully, it will turn in the second innings. Will be important for me and Virat to assess the conditions early. We have been good at our home ground as a batting unit. You got to pick your best batters and bowlers. <strong>Hasaranga comes in for Willey</strong>.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>WE HAVE A DEBUT&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; AS <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">VYSHAK VIJAYKUMAR</span> GETS HIS CAP IN THE <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">RCB CAMP</span>!</strong></p>\n",

Delhi Capitals pulled things back with a brilliant spell from Kuldeep Yadav and some great death bowling to restrict RCB to 174/6. The Faf Du Plessis-led side continued with the momentum in the second innings, courtesy of some fine new-ball bowling, picking up 4 wickets inside the Powerplay. Vyshak Vijaykumar had a dream debut and notched up figures of 3/20, helping RCB win by 23 runs and move to 4 points. Delhi on the other hand slipped to their 5th consecutive defeat in the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1681568577.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>David Warner, Delhi Capitals Captain:</strong></span> &quot;I said at the toss we needed to do all disciplines well, but we lost three early wickets and we didn&#39;t chase down what should have been an easy chase. Bangalore came out and started well with the ball, Siraj was outstanding. Our bowling and fielding were exceptional, and the energy we showed was great too. We have five days off and have to go back and have a hard look at ourselves. We need to do better with the bat and build partnerships at the top of the order. It is a matter of starting well with the bat. Teams have come back well from this position before and we can go on and do better.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf Du Plessis, Royal Challengers Bangalore Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We needed that win to get the confidence back in the group. Defending a total is not always easy at the Chinnaswamy, so very proud of them. It&#39;s the first day game of the season. Generally, the first six overs are more important. The way we bowled was just unbelievable. Huge credit to our seamers in the first six.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Virat Kohli is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Virat Kohli:</strong></span> &quot;I was quite disappointed that I got out to a full toss. I&#39;ve been playing really well. One thing I mentioned to the guys in the change room was that 175 was enough on this pitch. It slowed down considerably. We did well to get to that score and had the belief it was enough. When I&#39;ve played my best cricket, those are the balls I&#39;ve put away consistently. When I put away their best balls, it puts pressure on the bowlers. I back myself to hit good shots and when they come off they look good.&quot;</p>\n",

Both teams have winning momentum on their side having won their previous respective matches. KKR was involved in arguably the greatest finish this format has witnessed. Rinku Singh smashed 5 sixes off the last over to take the team home against GT. KKR has been riding off some individual performances from their players but has not shown the collective balance that the on-paper team promises. Venkatesh Iyer and Skipper Nitish Rana returning to form are a big positive for the side while the form of Andre Russell remains a big concern. The spin trio of Narine, Chakravarthy, and Suyash Sharma is the USP of the KKR team and has fared well so far. Their role will be more significant in the face-off against the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> middle order which consists of Aiden Markram and Rahul Tripathi who looked in good knick of things in their previous encounter against PBKS. The form of some of their star batters like Mayank Agarwal and Harry Brook will bother SRH but as they say, you are just a shot away from getting back in form and these two very well know how to bounce back. The bowling department looks complete in presence of Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Marco Jansen, T Natarajan, and Umran Malik along with spinners Washington Sundar &amp; Mayank Markande. One can expect a thriller of a game between two sides that are just coming to terms with the potential they possess.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\nLAST 25 IPL MATCHES AT KOLKATA (SINCE 2017) :&nbsp;<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST : 11<br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND : 14<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL : 180<br />\nAVG 1ST INN WIN <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/trophy-2.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />SCORE : 191</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>THE TEAM WINNING THE TOSS HAS ELECTED TO BOWL FIRST ON ALL THE 25 OCCASIONS!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/Head 2 Head (5)_1681481393.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:39px; width:68px\" title=\"\" /> <strong>wins the toss and elects to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; first!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 15_1681481445.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Nitish Rana, KKR Skipper: &quot;We&#39;ll bowl first.

SRH got off to a flying start after being asked to bat first by Nitish Rana. Harry Brook announced his arrival by smashing 12 boundaries and 3 maximums and went on to score his maiden 100 in the cash-rich league. Skipper Aiden Markram and Abhishek Sharma were his partners in the on-slaught. Only Sunil Narine was able to stop the flow of runs while other were taken to the cleaners by the SRH batters. A target of 229 was always going to be a daunting task, especially after losing three early wickets for just 20 runs. Jansen and Bhuvi were spot-on with the new ball. Just when one thought the match would be one-sided, began the fireworks from Skipper Nitish Rana who was having a different script in mind. The batter smashed 75 runs off 41 balls but failed to stay till the end. Rinku Singh the star of the previous game once again hit some lusty blows but could not take the team home tonight.

Both the teams have had a good run so far having won two of their three matches this season. Gujarat Titans won their season opener against CSK and then went on to beat Delhi in their second. They suffered a defeat at the hands of KKR in what one can say is a game for ages. The result was disappointing but GT was ahead of the 8-ball game till the 19th over courtesy of their stand in Skipper Rashid Khan who got a Hattrick in that game.<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />lineup will see Hardik Pandya walk into the side after recovering from illness. Sai Sudharsan and Vijay Shankar have been in outstanding form and the presence of batters like Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya, and David Miller makes the batting look far more destructive than their opponents. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> will have their task cut out against a strong-looking GT bowling which has match-winners in both spin and pace departments. Shikhar Dhawan was the only batter who displayed good form against SRH in their previous fixture. But the team might include Liam Livingstone who can be the icing on the cake for the PBKS side. The pace bowling unit looks settled with the likes of Arshdeep Singh and Nathan Ellis, adding Rabada will just take it to another level. A good chance to get back to winning ways for two sides that have lost their previous respective matches.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> <strong>and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;have clashed twice in IPL, The head-to-head record is even-steven!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nMurali Karthik &amp; Chris Morris: &quot; The pitch is an absolute beauty for the batters.

Both teams would be riding on the back of winning momentum having surpassed their respective opponents in their previous encounters. The Hosts Chennai Super Kings did not win their tournament opener against GT but have done well in the two games thereafter. Ruturaj Gaikwad has been in sensational form and holds the key to CSK&#39;s success. Other batters have had decent outings while MSD has finished well whenever got the opportunity. The side is yet to find its ideal combination due to injury concerns for most of their key players. Spinner Mitchell Santner has done a good job and Ravindra Jadeja has complimented him well.

The Top Order of Yashasvi Jaiswal, Jos Buttler, and Sanju Samson can take apart any bowling unit in a matter of 6 overs. Shimron Hetmyer in the middle order makes the batting look formidable, to say the least. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> seems to have a sorted bowling arsenal which has fared well so far.

In the middle overs, the spinners will come handy. In the game against the Super Giants, the spinners extracted a good amount of turn. There will turn and bounce on this surface.

The wicket might be slightly on the slower side, different from the first game. Dew might play a role and it might get better in the second innings. It feels good leading for the 200th time and also I feel the crowd has been fantastic. Also, the fact that we started in the old stadium, it was very hot and humid at that time But now it feels like we&#39;re playing in Switzerland. It&#39;s always good to play here. We have seen cricket change in terms of how T20 was played at that point of time till now, a lot has changed. The crowd has been fantastic all throughout. We have had injury concerns and players were unavailable, but still, we have done well.

Royals lost Yashasvi Jaiswal early but a partnership of 77(41) between Jos Buttler and Devdutt Padikkal kept the scoreboard ticking. Buttler top scored with 52 for RR. Cameos from Shimron Hetmyer and Ravi Ashwin helped the side get a fighting total of 175 runs on the board. It was Ravindra Jadeja&#39;s second spell that put breaks on the RR scoring rate in the middle overs. The left-arm spinner picked two wickets conceding just 21 off his 4 overs. In response, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" /> too lost its in-form opener Rururaj Gaikwad cheaply. Devon Conway and Ajinkya Rahane played as per the situation and compiled 68 off 43 between them. Conway top scored with 50 at a strike rate of 132. CSK lost its way when the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />Spinners ran through the middle order. Yuzvendra Chahal and Ravi Ashwin conceded only 52 runs in the eight overs between them and also accounted for four crucial wickets. Just when the chips were down, it was Ravindra Jadeja and the old war horse Mahendra Singh Dhoni who took on the bowling but failed by a very narrow margin in the end. MSD remained unbeaten on 32 from 17 but fell short to chase down the total by just 3 runs!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, CSK Skipper: &quot;I think in the middle overs we needed a bit more strike rotation, there wasn&#39;t much for the spinners but they had experienced spinners and we could not rotate strike. It was not that difficult and the ownership should come from the batters. It was good that we could reach striking distance (of the target) as we were the last pair. It really affects NRR when you get to the last phase of the tournament. You see the field, see the bowler and what the bowler is trying to do, and after that just stand still and wait for them to commit the mistake, if they bowl in good areas then good luck to them. I would wait for it and that is something that has worked for me, you need to back your strength and my strength is to hit straight.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Sanju Samson, RR Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;You have to give credit to the boys. Sandeep Sharma kept his cool at the end and bowled really well, we held on to our catches. Always have had good memories at Chepauk. The ball was gripping and hence, we brought Adam Zampa in as the Impact player. We had a good powerplay with Ruturaj Gaikwad getting out cheaply. The last two overs were tense but we got away. The match is not over until this man is out in the middle. We know what he is capable of. You have to have respect for that guy and what he can do.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>RAVICHANDRAN ASHWIN is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\"><strong>Ravichandran Ashwin: &quot;I surprised people I guess. That&#39;s a role given to me, we lost Sanju. i am far better at judging my strengths, I take a few balls to get going. Every batting inning, I am padded up from the start. It&#39;s not an easy thing but it is good. I came off with a good Test form. I feel I am able to get a good grip and drop the ball at the right lengths</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Both teams have not won a single match so far and would look to bounce back to winning ways. Capitals enter into this contest on the back of three defeats which came against LSG, GT, and RR. Skipper David Warner has been scoring runs but the same has not come at a strike rate that is expected from the Southpaw. Prithvi Shaw has not been in the best of forms either. The Top Order must fire if Delhi wants to go long in this tournament. Axar Patel and Lalit Yadav have been doing well according to their roles on the side. The Indian Pace battery of Khaleel Ahmed, Mukesh Kumar, and Chetan Sakariya has been expensive while Anrich Nortje has not had any major impact either. The bowling unit will need to come good against a side that is filled with some super-skilled shotmakers. Rohit Sharma and Co. have not got off to a good start either as the team has lost both of its encounters so far. Suffering defeats at the hands of CSK and RCB have raised many questions on their combination in the tournament in absence of some of their top players. Form of Rohit Sharma and Suryakumar Yadav at the Top is a major concern for the MI side. Ishan Kishan managed to get some runs on the board in the previous game but failed to capitalize. The bulk of the scoring has been done by Tilak Varma who has impressed everyone with his temperament while batting in difficult circumstances. Jofra Archer and Jason Behrendorff along with other Indian Pacers have leaked runs while the spin department consisting of Piyush Chawla, Hrithik Shokeen and Kumar Kartikeya has bowled some tight overs without much success. It will be an interesting contest between two teams that are looking to register their first win in the tournament!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\n<strong>Delhi and Mumbai have clashed 32 times. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />has won 15 whereas<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" /> has come out victorious on 17 occasions.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\nIPL &amp; T20I MATCHES AT DELHI SINCE 2018 :&nbsp;<br />\nWON BAT FIRST: 7<br />\nWON BAT SECOND: 13<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 174<br />\nAVG 1ST INN WIN SCORE: 182</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nChris Morris and Ian Bishop: &quot; The dimensions of the ground are quite unique. 60 metres and 70 metres are the two square boundaries.

The leggie accounted for three Delhi middle-order wickets giving away just 22 runs from his quota of four. Another twist came when Axar Patel unleashed his hitting prowess, the all-rounder smashed 54 runs at a strike rate of 216 helping DC post 172 on the board. Skipper David Warner played second fiddle compiling 51 at a meager strike rate of 108. In reply, the MI left-right duo of Ishan Kishan Rohit Sharma came out all guns blazing. The openers put on 71 runs off just 45 balls. Tilak Varma promoted at number three did justice to the role by rotating the strike and taking calculated risks. MI was cruising along until the DC finger spinners Axar Patel and Lalit Yadav put breaks on the MI scoring. Picking three wickets in a span of six balls brought DC back into the game. It was Tim David and Cameron Green who was able to stay calm and help <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> register their first win of this season.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">ROHIT SHARMA is the Player of the Match</span></strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, MI Skipper: &quot;Winning the game is the most important thing. We have been working hard since the first game. I say that every time, the First win is always special. It was necessary to include a spinner here. &nbsp;The spinners kept us in the game. We needed to bat well to chase the total. I thought everyone put their hand up. We had to make it count for the team. I needed to make use of the powerplay, I knew we had to keep attacking and take my chances. I tried to create a partnership and had good communication with Tilak. It was important for us to have a good partnership. We have young guys who haven&#39;t played IPL before, so it&#39;s important to have faith in them.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>David Warner, DC Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;If You look at the last three IPL games we have witnessed all three have been amazing. We ended up on the wrong end of it today, but the guys were fantastic. Rohit played a fantastic knock at the top of the order for MI. Anrich Nortje is a world-class bowler and that&#39;s what we expect from him also Mustafizur Rahman was up to the mark. I think from the last three games, we&#39;ve had some positives but we shouldn&#39;t lose wickets in clumps. Axar Patel should bat in the top four the way he is striking the ball. So, a lot of positives to take from the matches that have gone by so far.&nbsp;</strong></span><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n",

The Hosts started the tournament with a win at home but were completely outplayed at Eden Gardens against KKR. Virat Kohli and Skipper Faf du Plessis looked in outstanding form in the first game but failed to fire in the second. Their previous encounter saw the batting unit fall like a pack of cards as they managed only 123 while chasing 204. RCB bowlers have not had any major impact so far, only David Willey and Karn Sharma have kept the scoring in check while the rest of the bowlers have leaked runs going over 10 r.p.o. Their mettle will certainly be tested by the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> batting department which consists of KL Rahul, Kyle Mayers, Nicholas Pooran, and Marcus Stoinis. Mayers has been in sensational form along with Nicholas Pooran who has been destructive at the backend of the innings. Skipper KL Rahul will be expected to return to his original form at the venue where he happens to be a local boy. LSG bowling has fared well so far, especially in the spin department. Krunal Pandya, Ravi Bishnoi, and Amit Mishra can trouble any batting lineup even with little assistance on offer. A battle that can decide the fate of the game is the contest between the RCB top order and LSG Spinners.

Have you at the edge of your seat till the last moment! Chinnaswamy Stadium witnessed a thrilling game of Cricket between two sides that were neck to neck till the very last moment. RCB after being sent into bat got off to a flying start courtesy of their opening pair of Virat Kohli and Faf Du Plessis. The duo put together 96 runs before Kohli was dismissed by Amit Mishra for a score of 61. Thereafter it was Glenn Maxwell who joined the Skipper Faf to put on 100 runs off just 44 balls to take the team total to 212. Maxwell smashed 6 sixes and 3 fours in his 59-run knock. LSG lost 3 wickets in the first four overs with just 23 runs on the board. A partnership between KL Rahul and Marcus Stoinis kept the LSG hopes alive but the asking rate increased with every ball passing. Stoinis departed after compiling 65 off just 30 balls and made way for Nicholas Pooran who took over the responsibility to lead LSG home. The left-handed swashbuckler reached his fifty in just 15 balls and turned the game on its head. Pooran smashed 62 off just 19 balls before falling to Siraj in the 17th over of the game. Ayush Badoni the last of the recognized batter held one end up but was unlucky as he was out HIT-WICKET to a ball which he scooped for six! It was Team LSG that displayed nerves of steel and chased down the total on the last ball of the innings! LSG register their first win against Royal Challengers!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, LSG Skipper: &quot;This is the Chinnaswamy, the only venue where so many last-ball finishes are possible. From the position we were in, to end up winning it is superb. We had to go hard and the ball swung early, and they got 2-3 wickets to put the pressure on us. The only reason we got two points today is for the way the lower order batted.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, RCB Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;Very Disappointed. They played well through the middle. One ball one run. We backed ourselves to get a run-out. Just looking at the wicket, from 7-14 it was quite slow. In the last five overs, it started skidding. Really good for some good cricketing shots. Stoinis and Pooran played everything off the middle. They took on one of our main bowlers in his first couple of overs. It is a difficult place to bowl at the death.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>NICHOLAS POORAN is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Nicholas Pooran: &quot;I want to dedicate this performance to my wife and newborn. We knew that the game was on, and Stoinis and KL had a wonderful partnership. Stoinis kept us in the game and I knew this was a nice wicket. We could chase even over 50 in the last four, it was about cashing in. The second ball I came in and smashed a six. It isn&#39;t about getting a look in, if it is in my slot then I will smash it for six&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A thoroughly entertaining contest that kept everyone on their toes!<br><br>Here&#39;s a quick round up of the emotion-filled <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RCBvLSG?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RCBvLSG</a> clash which had twists and turns like no other ???? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TATAIPL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#TATAIPL</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/2CMUFu9K8I\">pic.twitter.com/2CMUFu9K8I</a></p>&mdash; IndianPremierLeague (@IPL) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IPL/status/1645629924785655808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 11, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>",

PBKS won both their matches defending the target and their batting and bowling looks quite fixed. SRH suffered in their batting department and are yet to make a score more than 131. The Orange Army will back their team today. Will PBKS continue their streak or will the hosts rise tonight?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report:<br />\nSimon Doull and Simon Katich:</strong> &quot;Here we have come from red soil to black soil. It&#39;s very dry with a few cracks. The team winning the toss will bat first potentially. We can expect a little bit of swing with the new ball. We can witness more spin than the other day. All in all, a pretty good surface.

Mayank Markande and Heinrich Klaasen are making their debut here today.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, PBKS Captain</strong></span>: &quot;We wanted to bat first however. We would like to put a big total. They lost two games while chasing, so we&#39;ll like to put them under pressure. It looks like a very good wicket. The whole team is performing, that&#39;s very important and happy for that. We have an experienced bowling side. In the batting, we have experience and youngsters. We have a change as Matthew Short comes in for Bhanuka Rajapaksa.&quot;</p>\n",

Mayank Markande was impressive with his wily variations which fetched him 4 wickets conceding only 15 runs. While chasing 145, SRH started well but lost both their openers by the end of the ninth over. It was a Rahul Tripathi show from there on which took the team home with 17 balls to spare.

As a batting unit, we lost too many wickets and couldn&#39;t put a big total on the board and this is the reason we lost the game. 175-180 would have been a reasonably good score. It was seaming and swinging a bit, we couldn&#39;t tackle that and fell short. We had to apply ourselves on this wicket. I was pleased with the bowling, there was not much to defend, lot of learning for us from this game. I am grateful for the 99 and I am very happy.

It was a little rough for us at the start but we are happy to win today. I am super happy for Mayank Markande. He bowled really well tonight. Also, Rahul Tripathi . He is a special talent. He is only a couple of balls away from something special and he showed his class tonight. Things get easy with Rahul at the other end. Great franchise to be a part of and it&#39;s our first win of the season, it means a lot to me as a Skipper of the side.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Both teams have momentum on their side having won their previous respective encounters. Titans have played two games so far and have won both their matches showing why they are the defending Champions of the cash-rich league. Shubman Gill, Sai Sudarshan, and Vijay Shankar have been doing the scoring with the bat while David Miller&#39;s inclusion provides that firepower finish that the Titans need at the backend of the innings. The bowling unit is well balanced with the likes of Mohammad Shami, Rashid Khan, Alzarri Joseph, and Skipper Hardik Pandya himself. GT has played some exciting cricket so far and would look to go past KKR taking their win tally to three. KKR under a new leader Nitish Rana has won 1 out of their two previous games this season. They won the game against RCB in a dominating manner and showed their true capabilities in both departments. It is KKR&#39;s bowling that has impressed everyone, especially their spin trio of Sunil Narine, Varun Chakravarthy, and Suyash Sharma. Tim Southee and Umesh Yadav make for a strong pace bowling pair that can be lethal with the new ball. Having players like Shardul Thakur and Andre Russell with all-around abilities makes the balance of the side even better. It will be interesting to see&nbsp; Nitish Rana&#39;s strategy against a solid team like Gujarat Titans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp; have faced each other <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/one.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> in IPL.

It was a good toss to win and bat first for the Titans. All the GT batters got to decent starts but it was the duo from Tamil Nadu; Sai Suddharsan and Vijay Shankar that did maximum damage. &nbsp;Sudharsan registered his second fifty of the season while Vijay Shankar played a destructive knock of 63* off just 24 balls to help the team post a target of 205. Narine was the pick of the bowlers getting three wickets while Umesh Yadav bowled economically conceding 8 r.p.o. The run chase did not start that well for the Knight Riders as they lost Rahmanullah Gurbaz and Jagadeesan cheaply within the powerplay. But a partnership of 100(55) between Impact Player Venkatesh Iyer and Skipper Nitish Rana kept KKR&#39;s hopes alive. It was Alzarri Joseph who tilted the momentum in GT&#39;s favor picking both the set batters in quick succession. The Skipper Rashid Khan who was not having the best of days came back out of nowhere accounting for the first Hattrick of IPL 2023 &nbsp;dismissing any chance of a win for the visitors. Who knew Rinku Singh had other plans? The batter smashed 31 runs off the last over to take the team home in an emphatic fashion! Rinku Singh remained unbeaten on 48 off 21 balls. &nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rashid Khan, GT Skipper: &quot;It&#39;s a tough game for us, especially for me as a captain. You need 30 plus in the last over, the same thing happened for us last year when we won. We will learn from it, more importantly a good game of cricket and the fans would have loved it.&quot;.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Nitish Rana, KKR Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;Honestly, We had a little belief. Rinku did something like this last year too, although we didn&#39;t go onto win that game. When the second six was struck, we started believing more because Yash Dayal wasn&#39;t executing that well. As a captain, it&#39;s important to have the belief. But this is a 1 in a 100 chance for something like this to happen and really glad that Rinku took us home the way he did.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>RINKU SINGH is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>RINKU SINGH: &quot;Had the belief that I can do it.

CSK and Thala Dhoni head into the match on the back of a win at Chepauk. Mumbai on the other hand have played only one match so far in the tournament and will look to register their first victory of the tournament tonight.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head to Head:-</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Rohit Sharma led side have had the advantage at Wankhede, winning 7 of the 10 games against CSK there. However, in the last 3 seasons the Head to Head between these two giants is 3-3 each. Who will turn out on top today?</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch Report :-</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Ian Bishop</strong>: &quot;Short leg-side boundary for the right-hander, just 63m and the fine-leg boundary is just 54m. Expect a lot of ramps today. The average score here in 2022 was 167, but teams will be hoping for more than that on a ground with these dimensions. There is a lot of grass, all the way through but no clear big patches, so the ball might do a little bit earlier. Hoping for a really good cricket match.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>DHONI HAS CALLED IT RIGHT AT THE TOSS AND CSK WILL FIELD FIRST!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 08_1680963050.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#d35400\">MS Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain:</span> &quot;We will bowl first. One of the most memorable venues, not only the 2011 win but when we won in 2007, when we came back the reception we got was great. We have a few injury concerns, <span style=\"color:#d35400\">Stokes has an injury, Mo is not available. Ajinkya and Pretorius are playing</span>. These are the two changes we have made.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, Mumbai Indians Captain:</span> &quot;It&#39;s a good pitch, always a good pitch to bat. Always something in it for the bowlers, and we just have to play good cricket. We have been really well in the last few days, spoke about what went wrong in our last game in Bangalore, hopefully we can get the result tonight. Unfortunately we have got an injury, I would not call it an injury but it is just a precaution - <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Jofra is not playing, we have got the other guys</span>. It is a great feeling to be back at the Wankhede. The crowds have always been loud, look forward to playing in front of our home crowd.&quot;</strong></p>\n",

Both Ishan Kishan &amp; Rohit Sharma got starts but failed to capitalize on the same. Spinners Ravindra Jadeja and Mitchell Santner brought about a shift in the momentum running past the MI top &amp; middle order. Left-arm spin accounted for 5 wickets between them giving away only 48 runs in 8 overs. A cameo of 31 from Tim David helped MI get to a respectable total of 157 which was always a tough one to defend against a deep batting lineup of <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" />. Jason Behrendorff provided the early breakthrough that MI needed but Ajinkya Rahane had different plans. The local boy smashed a 19-ball fifty and took the game away from the Mumbai Indians within the powerplay. Rahane scored 61 off 27 while Ruturaj played second fiddle remaining unbeaten on 40. In the end, CSK won the game comfortably by 7 wickets and 11 balls to spare!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rohit Sharma, MI Skipper: &quot;We lost our way in the middle and did not capitalize on the start we got. It was a good pitch and we were about 30-40 runs short. Have to give credit to their spinners, they bowled well and kept us under pressure. You need to try out different things, you need to attack and be brave. We have got a couple of young guys on the side and we got to give some time to them. They have real talent and we have to back them and show trust in their ability. The senior guys need to step up starting with me. We know the nature of this tournament, when the tournament starts we need to get some momentum and when we don&#39;t it is tough to get going. Just two games and all is not lost still. If you win, you can win a few on the trot, and when you lose it is hard to come out of that momentum. .&quot;&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>MS DHONI, CSK Skipper: &quot;It was not easy after losing Deepak Chahar in the first over, &nbsp;He is our new ball bowler and Mangala is playing his first match. The good thing is spinners bowled well and got us the game. It was a bit two-paced after 7 overs and started turning as well. &nbsp;Mangala was good and so was Pretorious in their second spells. Also, Deshpande, We believe in his abilities and when you&#39;re new you are under pressure but playing in the IPL for a few years brings different pressure. He had a great domestic season, he is improving. I and Ajinkya Rahane spoke at the start of the season and I told him to play to his strengths and use his ability to manipulate the fields. I told him to go and enjoy himself, don&#39;t take the stress and we&#39;ll back him. That is exactly what he did.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>RAVINDRA JADEJA is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ravindra Jadeja: &quot;When we were bowling, the odd ball was turning. So I and Mitch wanted to bowl in good areas because they have so many power hitters. Every time we come here, the wicket plays differently, sometimes it is flat, and sometimes it is sticky. I and Santner discuss everything and whoever starts advises the other person on what lengths to bowl. We keep talking and advising each other.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The visitors have played two matches so far and have lost both. The Skipper David Warner has been scoring runs but has not been at his best in terms of the strike rate of the opening batter. Mitchell Marsh and Prithvi Shaw both have not fired so far which restricts the capitals from getting off to a flying start. A few good knocks have been played by Sarfaraz Khan, Rilee Rossouw, and Axar Patel but have not created any impact. The pace department consisting of Mukesh Kumar, Khaleel Ahmed, Chetan Sakariya has not lived up to the expectations so far but the arrival of Anrich Nortje will just help lift their morale in the coming days. Spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel know how to bounce back from tough situations and will be expected to step up against a Royals setup that is filled with some Powerpack performers. Jos Buttler, Sanju Samson, and Yashasvi Jaiswal have already given glimpses of what they are capable of. All three top-order batters have registered a fifty to their name. Yuzvendra Chahal has been doing the damage with the ball alongside Trent Boult who has been terrific in the powerplay. Jason Holder and R Ashwin have kept it tight from the other end.

The left-right duo was going over 11 r.p.o when the fielding restrictions were on. A partnership of 98 off just 50 balls shattered the DC bowler&#39;s confidence early in the innings. It was a total shift in momentum after the wicket of Jaiswal and DC managed to pull things back a little. But Hetmyer had other plans. Hetmyer remained unbeaten with 39 off 21 balls to his name. Jaiswal and Buttler smashed 60 &amp; 79 respectively. Chasing a target of 200 under lights was never going to be easy especially after losing 2 wickets off the first over itself. Boult hit the first blow by picking Shaw and Pandey in the first over itself. Warner did get going from one end but failed to score at a brisk rate. Lalit Yadav was the only batter who played as per the required rate while the rest failed to cross even the 20-run mark. Trent Boult and Yuzi Chahal picking three wickets apiece gave nothing away to the DC batters. DC managed to score only 140 losing the game by a huge margin of 57 runs.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">David Warner, Delhi Capitals Captain:</span> &quot;When you are chasing 200, you need to start well. It is just about executing your skills. It is frustrating to hit to the fielders. Just didn&#39;t go to plan.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\">Sanju Samson, Rajasthan Royals Captain:</span> &quot;Almost everything went to plan. The way I play this format I take a few balls to settle in and then go out there and express myself. My role in the team is very clear. Last game when we played here, it was a swimming pool and we were not able to keep the ball dry, we will have to get used to wet balls. Yuzi and Ash bhai know how to do it with the wet ball. The ball being new was very crucial for us and Ash bhai got through two important overs.&quot;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\">Yashasvi Jaiswal</span> is the Player of the Match</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#ff00ff\">Yashasvi Jaiswal:</span> &quot;I have worked hard.

Although they lost their previous game against CSK, they had a good first game at their home against the Delhi Capitals. Kyle Mayers has been the top performer with the bat and has taken the team off to a flying start in both games. The opener is striking at 215 while his teammate from West Indies Nicholas Pooran is striking the ball well too. it will be interesting to see the batting order with the inclusion of Quinton de Kock in the LSG camp. Looking at the bowling side of things, Mark Wood has bowled steamy spells and has picked 8 wickets so far in the tournament. Ravi Bishnoi has kept things tight and also chipped in with wickets at crucial moments. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /> on the other side faltered against Rajasthan Royals in their tournament opener by 72 runs.

This year I&#39;m in a good headspace altogether. Once you have clarity up there, things fall in place. I&#39;m very process-driven and don&#39;t think about results. Want to dedicate this to my wife who has always supported me&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

Umesh Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy bowled economically but Tim Southee , Shardul Thakur and Sunil Narine conceded above 10 r.p.o. Nitish Rana who has just taken up the leadership role for KKR could have been tactical with his bowling changes as a few bowlers in the side were not utilised despite others leaking runs. WHile chasing 191, KKR lost early wickets and failed to get the momentum on their side. Impact Player Venkatesh Iyer and Nitish Rana looked in good touch while Rana got a start but failed to capitalize.

Mohammad Siraj was lethal in the first game and Karn Sharma too chipped in with wickets. the run-chase of 171 was made to look too petty courtesy of some impeccable batting from Skipper Faf du Plessis and King Kohli. A partnership of 148 between the openers gabe no chance to the opposition to stage a come back. Kohli smashed an unbeaten 82 (49) while Faf made 73 at a strike rate of 170. This is also one of the oldest rivalry in IPL as RCB &amp; KKR contested the first ever IPL Match in 2008.

The <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:33px; width:70px\" title=\"\" /> beat Sunrisers Hyderabad while <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:38px; width:86px\" title=\"\" /> went past &nbsp;Kolkata Knight Riders in their respective season opener. Sanju Samson led RR won in a dominating fashion courtesy of their batting which decimated the opposition in the powerplay itself. The Top order which consists of Jos Buttler, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Sanju Samson smashed half-centuries and also crossed the 100 run mark in just 7.4 Overs which is their quickest in the Cash Rich League. Their Premier Bowler Trent Boult too started in an emphatic manner dismissing two of their top three in the first over of the innings. Likes of Jason Holder, KM Asif, and Ravi Ashwin kept things tight while Spin King Yuzvendra Chahal kept picking wickets at regular intervals. The Purple cap holder of the previous season scalped four wickets conceding 17. The <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" />bowling unit will have to be on their guard going against A <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" /> lineup that was terrific against KKR the other day. All of the seven batters that got a chance to take the field got off to a start and most importantly played according to their roles. Bhanuka Rajapaksa top scored with 50 at a strike rate of 156 while Skipper Shikhar Dhawan compiled 40 playing the sheet anchor role. While defending 191 Left Arm Pacer Arshdeep Singh provided early breakthroughs while Spinners Rahul Chahar, Sikandar Raza, and Brar bowled economic spells. PBKS would also be excited to welcome Kagiso Rabada and Liam Livingstone who will strengthen both their batting and bowling against a tough opponent. The Clash will take place at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati which is Rajasthan Royals&#39; second home ground.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nIn the 24 clashes between them, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> have won 14 while 10 matches have been clinched by the <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" />!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Daren Ganga</strong>: &quot;The dimensions of the ground are quite unique in a way that the square boundaries vary from one another.

The openers got the team off to a flying start smashing 63 runs in the powerplay. Prabhsimran Singh scored 60 off just 34 balls while the Skipper Shikhar Dhawan leading from the front remained unbeaten on 86 off 56 balls. Holder was amongst wickets and Ravi Ashwin bowled economically but PBKS managed to set a big target of 198 for the Royals. RR had a new pair of Yashasvi Jaiswal and Ravi Ashwin to start with in absence of Jos Buttler who came in at number three. Batters were playing as per the asking rate but kept losing wickets at regular intervals courtesy of some brilliant bowling from Nathan Ellis who accounted for four middle-order wickets. Sanju Samson top scored with 42 (25) at a strike rate of 168. The momentum had totally shifted in PBKS&#39; favour until a partnership of 62 off 27 balls between Shimron Hetmyer and Dhruv Jurel almost got RR home. Hetmyer scored 36 from 18 while Jurel remained not out on 32 from 15 balls.

Our bowlers used the variations well on a high-scoring wicket and I thought we did quite well to restrict them to 197.I was expecting the dew to come in the second innings, but it was evident that it was there right at the start, need to be prepared better for such things in the next game.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, PBKS Skipper: &quot;There were some nervous moments, I was trying to keep my calm and discussing plans with my bowlers.

It was a full team effort.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>NATHAN ELLIS <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Nathan Ellis: &quot;Just stoked to get the win under the belt, pleased to get some awards but from a team&#39;s point of view nice to get that win. In T20 every ball matters, staying in the moment is the key. When I was bowling in the backend, I was trying to get my variations right and calculate what the best ball is at that time.

The Titans picked up from where they left the previous season ticking almost all the boxes. Shubman Gill looked in sublime touch smashing 63 off just 36 balls while Wriddhiman Saha, Sai Sudarshan, and Vijay Shankar complimented the Opener from the other end. The presence of the likes of Hardik Pandya, Rahul Tewatia, and Rashid Khan makes for a destructive middle order that can dismantle any bowling attack. Pace Bowlers Mohammad Shami and Alzarri Joseph had a good first game while the Left Arm pace battery of Joshua Little and Yash Dayal conceded at 10.20 and 14 r.p.o respectively. Rashid Khan&#39;s all-round performance helped GT win the season opener by 5 wickets But the team will definitely miss the services of Top order batter Kane Williamson who is ruled out of the tournament due to an injury sustained in the previous game. The Capitals on the other side would want to come back stronger in their own backyard after suffering a heavy loss at the hand of LSG in their season opener. Dropping Kyle Mayers early in the match cost them the game against LSG. All the DC bowlers were taken to the cleaners and Khaleel Ahmed was the only bowler who conceded less than 8 r.p.o. Likes of Mukesh Kumar and Chetan Sakariya coming off an impressive domestic season would want to replicate their performance in the cash-rich league while the Spin department consists of Axar &nbsp;Patel and Kuldeep Yadav possesses enough experience to bounce back after a bad day at work. Delhi is a formidable unit, especially its batting department which has some big names like Skipper David Warner, Prithvi Shaw, Mitchell Marsh, and Rovman Powell. A high-scoring match can be anticipated between sides that is filled with some clean strikers of the cricket ball.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong><br />\n<strong>IPL &amp; T20I MATCHES AT DELHI SINCE 2018 :&nbsp;</strong><br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> FIRST: <strong>7</strong><br />\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" /> SECOND: <strong>12</strong><br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: <strong>174</strong><br />\nAVG 1ST INN WIN SCORE: <strong>182</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br />\nAaron Finch: &quot;</strong>Dimensions of 64 meters on either side and 70 metres down the ground. This wicket is smack bang in the middle. Remember what we saw a couple of weeks ago in the Test match, there was not a blade of grass to be seen. This wicket has a nice even covering of grass. This is an unbelievably flat wicket. I expect there will be a little bit more pace and a little bit more carry to assist the swing and the seam bowlers. But there are a couple of parts on this wicket that are very dry. Even though they are dry, don&#39;t expect that to have a huge influence on this game. 165 is the average score here. The trend of this tournament has teams wanting to chase. Personally, I wouldn&#39;t be against trying to bat first.<strong>&quot;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:<br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />got the better of&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" /> in the only encounter between the franchises!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-<br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" /> wins the toss and elects to field first!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></span></p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, GT Skipper: &quot;Going to have a bowl first.

The momentum changed in the 9th over when Alzarri Joseph got the wickets of David Warner and Rilee Rossouw off consecutive deliveries. Mohammad Shami&#39;s spell in the powerplay accounted for two crucial top-order wickets of Shaw and Marsh which dented DC&#39;s scoring rate. Sarfaraz Khan and Debutant Abhishek Porel managed a few runs but failed to convert the same into big scores. Axar Patel&#39;s cameo at the backend ensured that DC reaches a respectable total of 162. In response, GT did not get the best of starts either, Shubman Gill, Wriddhiman Saha, and Skipper Hardik Pandya were back in the hut before the powerplay but the run rate was well above the asking rate at that point. A partnership of 53 between Sai Sudharsan and Vijay Shankar steadied the GT Ship and ensured that DC has no way to come back into the game. Some lusty blows from Miller sealed the game for the Titans with 11 balls to spare. Sudharsan top scored with an unbeaten 62 off 48 balls while Shankar and Miller scored 29 and 31 respectively. Gujarat Titans do not have many big names in the side but all the players are capable to change the course of the game on a given day. Role definition is the key here!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>David Warner, DC Skipper: Don&#39;t think I was surprised with the early movement that GT seamers got. It did swing more than anticipated. Also, from the other end, it kept a little low. They showed how to adapt to such situations. We Got another 6 games here so we have to get things on track. Have to be on point and expect that swing in the first few overs. We were in the game till the end but they played well. Sai Sudharsan batted well. Miller does what he does. With the dew also, it&#39;ll be challenging if you don&#39;t get 180-190.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, GT Skipper: It was actually funny at the start, we didn&#39;t know what was happening honestly, but something was happening. The way the bowlers pulled back was amazing. I go with my instinct when it comes to deciding when to bowl whom. I like to back myself. Most often than not, I punch first rather than taking the punch. It helps you take the right decisions. The team is doing well, Someone&#39;s putting their hand up and taking responsibility. Speaking about Sai Sudharsan, he has been batting terrifically. His hard work is showing!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>SAI SUDHARSAN is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Sai Sudharsan: &quot;I am a little bit nervous as this is my first award. I was thinking about what needs to be done right. I wasn&#39;t under any pressure. It was a bit low and skidding initially, my plan was to take the game deep and take it forward from there. Weathering the storm was more satisfying.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Action Returns to Chepauk in Match No.6 of IPL, 2023 where the Chennai Super Kings will be host to the Super Giants from Lucknow. CSK will be playing in their own backyard after four long years. All eyes will be on Mahendra Singh Dhoni who is just 8 runs short of Landmark 5000 runs in IPL. The four-time champions did not have the best of starts having lost to Gujarat Titans in their first match of the season. Ruturaj Gaikwad looked in brilliant touch smashing 92 runs off just 50 deliveries but lacked support from the other batters while Rajvardhan Hangargekar bowled his heart out picking three crucial wickets. Skipper, MSD did not get enough time in the middle but did manage to hit one lusty blow out of the park. The Home crowd will anticipate the likes of Moeen Ali, Devon Conway, Ben Stokes, and Ravindra Jadeja to put up a show at the fortress against a team that is riding high on confidence. LSG has been consistent in its performances throughout the last season and has started the 2023 edition with a win. LSG went past the Capitals in a dominating manner winning the match by a margin of 50 runs. The West Indian duo of Kyle Mayers and Nicholas Pooran were instrumental in the Team&#39;s success but the main damage was done by Mark Wood who accounted for 5 scalps conceding just 14 runs. Wood was previously a part of the CSK setup in 2018 where he played just one game for the yellow army. LSG is a formidable side with the right balance considering the presence of All-rounders in their ranks. But it all comes down to how the KL Rahul team handles the pressure of playing the Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong><br />\nMATCHES AT CHENNAI SINCE <strong>2018</strong> :&nbsp;<br />\nWON BAT FIRST: <strong>10</strong><br />\nWON BAT SECOND: <strong>9</strong><br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: <strong>153</strong><br />\nAVG 1ST INN WIN SCORE: <strong>167</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://scores.bcci.tv/matchcentre/commentaryFiles/IPL 06_1680532024.png\" style=\"width:640px\" /></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:21px; width:80px\" title=\"\" />and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:31px; width:82px\" title=\"\" /> have encountered only ONCE, <strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">LSG</span></strong> came out victorious chasing down 211 and winning by 6 wickets!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" /><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">win the toss and elect to field first!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, LSG Skipper: &quot;We&#39;ll field first.

Gaikwad scored his second fifty of the season while Conway complimented him with 47 of just 29 balls. Ravi Bishnoi did manage to pull it back a little after dismissing Gaikwad but cameos from Shivam Dube, Ambati Rayudu, and MSD helped CSK reach a huge total of 217. An asking rate of 10.85 was always going to be a difficult chase with the spinners available in the CSK ranks. LSG did make the most of the powerplay courtesy of some hard-hitting by Kyle Mayers who was on fire once again. Mayers registered his second fifty finishing with 53 of just 22 balls. CSK Spinners Mitchell Santner and Moeen Ali put breaks on the scoring rate and also kept picking wickets at regular intervals. The spin duo conceded just 47 from their 8 overs. Ali was the pick of the bowlers accounting for 4 LSG wickets. LSG did good to reach 205 but fell short by 12 runs to breach the fortress!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, LSG Skipper: &quot;Not the ideal start after winning the toss. The first couple of overs it was a bit sticky and there was a bit of movement, but we did not bowl in the right areas and they got that flier. When you have quality batters in the opposition, they make you pay. Something for us to learn but the way Rutu and Conway played was brilliant. It does take time to learn what lengths to bowl on a surface, but to go for 70-odd in six overs isn&rsquo;t ideal. We batted well but we didn&rsquo;t capitalize on the small momentum.&quot;.</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, CSK Skipper: &quot; All of us were thinking how the wicket would play. I initially thought it would be much slower. But it was a wicket where you could actually score runs. Fast bowling needs to improve. Bowlers Need to bowl according to the conditions. What is important is to be aware as to what the opposition bowlers are doing and going about with their plans. One more thing if they&#39;ll have to bowl no no-balls or wides they&#39;ll have to find a new captain. It will be my second warning and then I&#39;ll be off. Only reason we&#39;ve scored those runs is if the surface is nice.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Moeen Ali is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Moeen Ali : &quot;They have big hitters. Almost tried to bowl like Test cricket. Tried to spin the ball. The combination was nice (with Santner). The partnership worked well. MS knows what he&#39;s doing. He knows when to bowl players..&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

MI is one of the most successful Cricket franchises in the world with five IPL titles to their credit. The side has done wonders under the captaincy of Rohit Sharma in the past few years. But the team would look for a better season after a disastrous 2022 outing. MI will not have the services of their star bowler Jasprit Bumrah for this season but the addition of Jofra Archer can fill up that pace bowler slot for the Mi bowling unit. The inclusion of All-rounder Cameron Green provides a lot of balance to the MI lineup. Ishan Kishan, Suryakumar Yadav, and Skipper Rohit Sharma make for an amazing Top order and the presence of Tim David, Tristan Stubbs and Dewald Brewis in the middle order completes the batting requirements. The Pace attack consists of Archer, Cameron Green, Jason Behrendorff, Sandeep Warrier, and Arjun Tendulkar while the spin department has the likes of Hrithik Shokeen and Kumar Kartikeya. Looking at their opponents, RCB had a good outing in the previous season where they made it to the playoffs. A big plus for the side is the current form of Virat Kohli. Faf du Plessis has been able to find the right combination of having both youth and experience in the side. The side needs Glenn Maxwell their T20 specialist to come well if the team has to go the distance. Other Overseas stars in the RCB ranks are Finn Allen, Michael Bracewell, David Willey, Wanindu Hasaranga and Reece Topley. The Indian contingent consists of Mohammad Siraj, Harshal Patel, Suyash Prabhudessai, and the finisher Dinesh Karthik who can feature in the playing eleven. It will be a cracker of a contest between two teams containing a lot of firepower!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Head to Head :-</strong></p>\n\n<p>Both the teams have squared off against each other 30 times with&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;leading the tally with 17 wins.

Our Four overseas players are Tim David, Cameron Green, Jofra Archer and Jason Behrendorff.

MI top order was back in the hut before the powerplay got over and the run-rate was less than 5 r.p.o. Skipper Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Cameron Green fell cheaply while Surya got a start but failed to convert it into a big score. The only batter who looked in form was Tilak Varma who played a blinder scoring an unbeaten 84 off 46 deliveries. In response to a target of 172, Virat Kohli and Skipper Faf du Plessis came out all guns blazing. The duo added 148 runs in 14.5 overs and took the game away from the opposition. Faf was the one who started the onslaught and Virat Kohli followed the path. Faf&#39;s 73 (43) and Virat&#39;s unbeaten 82 (49) ensured that RCB secure the total with 3.4 overs to spare. It was a treat to watch batters like Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis in such a kind of form!</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rohit Sharma, MI Captain:</span> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;Didn&rsquo;t have a great start with the bat in the powerplay. But, it was a really good effort from Tilak Varma and a few other batters in the end. But, we didn&rsquo;t execute well with the ball too. Tilak Varma is a positive person, and quite talented as well. Some of the shots he played, showed a lot of courage. Hats off to Tilak to get us to a competitive total of 171. We didn&#39;t even bat to half of our potential. Probably 30-40 runs more would have been ideal. Without Jasprit Bumrah, Of course, this is a different setup but someone needs to put their hand up and step up. We can&#39;t keep dwelling in the past. Injuries are not in our control, we can&#39;t do much about it. The other guys in the setup are quite talented as well. We need to give them that support. Just the first game of the season, there&#39;s a lot to look forward to.&quot;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>FAF DU PLESSIS is the Player of the Match.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plessis, RCB Captain: &quot;Nice to start the way we did. Initially in the powerplay , Siraj had the tail up and he set the tone for us. Right through the innings, our bowlers stuck to the plans and executed them perfectly. &nbsp;If you took pace off the ball, it wasn&#39;t too easy to play and there was something in it for the spinners too but as a batter if you got into good positions you could score runs on this track. My first time playing here as a home player and it&#39;s a special feeling, especially batting with Virat Kohli. Energy bounces off him. &nbsp; This start will be huge for us as a team.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

The home team has made a lot of changes in their previous season&#39;s squad where they finished 8th in the points table. The Englishman Harry Brook was their most expensive buy for a whopping 13.25 cr. Mayank Agarwal coming off a brilliant domestic season is another name that can change the fortunes of the Sunrisers. They also have a new leader in Aiden Markram who will miss the first game and Bhuvneshwar Kumar is set to take charge for the season opener. The other overseas players to watch out for includes Glenn Phillips, Adil Rashid, and Fazalhaq Farooqi. The Indian talent consists of the star performer with the bat last season Rahul Tripathi, Abhishek Sharma, Washington Sundar, and speed guns Umran Malik and T Natarajan. The Royals camp on the other side has not made many changes to their squad after a good outing last year where they finished Runners-up. Skipper Sanju Samson, Jos Buttler, Shimron Hetmyer, Devdutt Padikkal, and Yashasvi Jaiswal make the batting look destructive, especially after the inclusion of the All-rounder Jason Holder who adds a lot of balance to the side. The spin department oozes with class in presence of Ravi Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal while Trent Boult will spearhead the pace attack. Both the teams have some exciting talent that can ensure a mouth-watering contest in the first of the super Sunday doubleheader.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/SRH-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:29px; width:79px\" title=\"\" />and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/RR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:33px; width:70px\" title=\"\" /> have rubbed shoulders with each other in a total of 16 matches in the IPL so far and it&#39;s all even as both sides have managed to win eight games a piece.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br />\nDAY MATCHES IN <span style=\"color:#d35400\">HYDERABAD</span> IPL 2018 &amp; 19 :&nbsp;<br />\nWON BAT FIRST: 2<br />\nWON BAT SECOND: 1<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 191</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pitch report Sanjay Manjrekar :</strong> &quot;Once again a fantastic venue, the pitch is more or less central- pretty even boundaries all along. The pitch looks pristine, a bit like how an English pitch would be, covered by dried grass and white in color. There won&#39;t be the ready-made turn for the spinners. Hyderabad has been a high-scoring venue, teams that have won chasing have an average score of 190. So that tells you this is a venue where you are better off chasing, because sometimes in the pressure to get runs on the board, you end up with just 150-160. The pitch is perfect, one where you would want to chase.

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Lucknow Super Giants will face the Delhi Capitals in Match No.3 of IPL,2023. LSG impressed everyone with their performance in their first season last year as the KL Rahul-led side finished third on the table. DC on the other side did not do that well last year but has been playing consistently for some time now. DC will miss the services of their Captain Rishabh Pant and David Warner is set to take charge in his absence. The site consists of some super strikers like David Warner, Prithvi Shaw, Mitchell Marsh, Rovman Powell, and Manish Pandey in the ranks who can take apart any bowling unit on a given day while the bowling unit comprises Anrich Nortje, Mustafizur Rahman, Chetan Sakriya , Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav which can trouble any batting unit on any track. They will have their task cut out against an LSG batting Unit that has some quality players like KL Rahul, Quinton De Kock, Nicholas Pooran, Deepak Hooda, and Marcus Stoinis. Their bowling responsibility will rest on the shoulders of Mark Wood, Avesh Khan, Jaydev Unadkat, and spinners Ravi Bishnoi and Krunal Pandya. In a tournament where momentum matters the most, both teams would want to get off to a flying start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Ian Bishop: </strong>&quot; The 22-yards is interesting because there&#39;s very little grass at one end. It&#39;s very bare and the ball may grip on this half. As we walk down, you can see the disparity. You get to the middle, you start seeing more grass, and it&#39;s patchy as well. So it&#39;s a pitch with contrasting halves. There&#39;s so much more grass on one side, but it&#39;s patchy grass. So when it hits the bald areas, it could hold. Hoping that the red soil makes the bounce and carry.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Delhi Capitals won the toss and elected to field first!</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>David Warner, Delhi Capitals Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;Going to have a bowl. For us it&#39;s about trying to assess conditions early and knowing what to chase. Choosing the impact player can be quite confusing, maybe stressful at times. I&#39;m excited to be back. We send our best wishes out to Rishabh.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>KL Rahul, Lucknow Super Giants Skipper:</strong></span> &quot;That&#39;s how most IPL teams work, they want to make their home ground their fortress. We haven&#39;t played here. We&#39;re going in with no expectations, for all you know, it might be a good batting wicket. The Impact Player is new, still getting used to it. It gives teams a chance to be in the game or come back in the game. It&#39;s fun. Hopefully it&#39;s a good change.&quot;</p>\n",
            "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>Powerplay (1-6 Overs) :-</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>LSG- 30/1 (5.0 rpo, 1x4, 1x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>|| </strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>DC- 47/2 (7.8 rpo, 8x4, 0x6)</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Middle Overs (7-15 Overs) :-</strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>LSG - 100/3 (11.1 rpo, 2x4, 9x6)&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>|| </strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>DC- 63/3 (7.0 rpo, 5x4, 1x6)</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong>Death Overs (16-20 Overs) :-&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>LSG- 63/1 (12.6 rpo, 2x4, 6x6)&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>|| </strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>DC- 33/4 (6.6 rpo, 2x4, 1x6)</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>LSG start their campaign in an emphatic manner in front of their home crowd. It was Kyle Mayers who put up some show with the bat smashing 73 of just 38 balls. Mayers hit 7 maximums and 2 boundaries which set the tone for LSG to set a big total on board. Nicholas Pooran and Ayush Badoni playing vital cameos helped the team reach a score of 193. Khaleel Ahmed was the most economical of the bowlers but dropping Mayers early on in the innings proved to be the party spoiler for DC. LSG bowlers too came out all guns blazing. It was an out-and-out Mark Wood show, the Englishman dismissed Shaw and Marsh of consecutive deliveries and went on to pick 5 wickets in total. DC Skipper David Warner and Rilee Rossouw were the only batters that got some runs under their belt while the rest of the unit failed to get going. DC never looked like chasing down the total once the asking rate was over 10 r.p.o. Avesh Khan and Ravi Bishnoi chipped in with two wickets each while the impact player Krishnappa Gowtham made sure that the run rate was in check. DC ultimately lost the game by 50 runs which is a huge margin in a T20 match.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>KL Rahul, LSG Captain: &quot;It was a great start. We were clueless about the pitch but read it well. We&#39;ll take confidence from this win into our next games. Toss is not in our hands but with the new rules, you get to play with the team you want. Gives great depth in the bowling and batting department. I thought we were 30 runs above par after the first innings. The way Kyle Mayers batted took the game away from the opposition. We took an aggressive approach against the spinners and put them under pressure straight away. I thought they started pretty well, but we came back well to pick wickets at the right time. It was Mark Wood&#39;s day today, it&#39;s a dream for a fast bowler and a team. He made it count.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>David Warner, DC Captain: &quot; It was a bit of a challenge. We had some early momentum with the fast bowlers, they bowled very well in the powerplay. A few dropped catches and the momentum shifted there but you can&#39;t take anything away from Lucknow. They batted very very well. I thought 170 was a par score but they did an exceptional job. Momentum is a big thing in this game. Don&#39;t take it away from Wood, he&#39;s an exceptional bowler and he showed his true talent tonight. &quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>MARK WOOD is the Player of the Match.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Mark Wood: &quot;Last time I played for CSK, but it didn&#39;t go quite well. But I wanted to make an impact in this game. The landing area was a bit of an issue, but I am pleased with my rhythm as I managed to take wickets. We have trained here, so we knew dew was going to be a factor. Tried to keep things simple, the planning with Morne helped me&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Two teams that start their IPL 2023 campaign are the Kings from Punjab and Knight Riders from Kolkata. Both Teams failed to create an impact in the previous season finishing in the bottom half of the points table and would definitely look to start the season on a winning note. Another thing in common between the two sides is the change in leadership. Shikhar Dhawan will captain the PBKS side while another Delhi boy Nitish Rana is set to lead KKR in absence of the injured Shreyas Iyer. The Knight Riders have retained a lot of their players from the previous season and look formidable. Overseas ALL Rounders like Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Shakib Al Hasan, and David Wiese provide a lot of balance while the Indian contingent of players like Shardul Thakur, Umesh Yadav, and Varun Chakravarthy make the bowling department look settled. PBKS on the other side have stars like Kagiso Rabada, Liam Livingstone, Bhanuka Rajapaksa, and the most expensive buy in the history of IPL, Sam Curran. The PBKS bowling department too is filled with Indian Bowlers like Arshdeep Singh, Rahul Chahar, and Harpreet Brar. It will be interesting to see the two lineups, especially considering the new set of players inducted and the new Impact Player Rule. <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/PK-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:38px; width:86px\" title=\"\" /> will expect a reversal in fortunes this season while two-time champions <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:39px; width:68px\" title=\"\" />would want to taste the success once again. Let the Game Begin!&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nBoth the Teams have clashed 30 times and KKR has had the better of the opposition winning 20 games while PBKS has managed to win 10 matches.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Daren Ganga:</strong> &quot;The pitch is light brown in colour which means there is not a lot of moisture. It&#39;s also very hard, so it might be more even for teams batting first and chasing. There&#39;s a good covering of grass, looks quite even. Dimensions of the ground are unique. If you go to the eastern side, it&#39;s the larger of the two boundaries - 72 meters in distance, and also against the wind. That&#39;s not where you want to hit. Down the ground is 77 meters. Spinners would want to capitalize on that.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong><br />\nMATCHES: 15&nbsp;<br />\nWON BAT FIRST : 3<br />\nWON BAT SECOND: 12<br />\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL : 159</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/KKR-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:39px; width:68px\" title=\"\" /> <strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">win the toss and elect to field first!</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Nitish Rana, KKR Skipper: </strong></span>&quot;We will bowl first, it has rained in the last two days so there would be some moisture. I am excited because very few people get this opportunity. It is a game of cricket after all.&nbsp; so not taking much pressure.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan , PBKS Skipper:</strong></span><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong> &quot;</strong></span>We would have fielded first.

            "PostMatchCommentary": "<p><strong>PBKS start their 2023 campaign with a win in this rain-affected contest at Mohali. PBKS put up 191 on board after being sent into bat by Nitish Rana. It was the partnership of 86 between the PBKS Skipper Shikhar Dhawan and Bhanuka Rajapaksa that shifted the momentum in their favour. All the PBKS batters got to a start which is a good sign going forward in the tournament. Umesh Yadav and Varun Chakravarthy were economical but the rest of the KKR bowlers conceded above 10 r.p.o. In response, KKR lost three wickets in the powerplay after which the going got tough for the Knight Riders. Skipper Nitish Rana, Impact player Venkatesh Iyer and Andre Russell did strike some lusty blows but none of the three went on to get a big one which resulted in KKR managing just 146 falling short by 7 runs (as per DLS method). Arshdeep picking up three out of the four top-order wickets was the pick of the bowlers for PBKS with help from the spinners Rahul Chahar and Harpreet Brar bowled tight overs from the other end. A win is a win and taking winning momentum in the next contest is always vital in this format.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Shikhar Dhawan, PBKS Captain: &quot;It&#39;s a great feeling to start the tournament with a win, we&#39;ll try to take the momentum in the next game and carry that confidence ahead. According to the situation I used those bowlers, good thing we have got plenty of bowlers on the side. I knew Raza was going to be handy against the left-handers, so he gave us three quality overs. Also have experienced bowlers like Sam Curran and Arshdeep on the side. Wanted to be aggressive and at the same time smart. They are youngsters and they are learning. We all are living our dream and we should be happy about it. As a leader, I make sure the team stays relaxed and in a happy state of mind.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Nitish Rana, KKR Captain: &quot; Was thinking of using Anukul with the ball but didn&#39;t find the right situation for it. Russell not bowling at the death wasn&#39;t because of any injury issue. I just felt like going with my five main bowlers. They batted well, and judged the wicket better than us.&quot;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Arshdeep Singh is the Player of the Match</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>&quot;All I tried to do is be unpredictable. The wicket was also good for batting so I was trying to mix it up. Players were expecting that I will bowl yorkers so I tried up to surprise them a bit by bowling those bouncers and slow bouncers. There was some drizzle around so the wicket had become skiddy that is why I was using the conditions on offer. I am enjoying myself and the atmosphere around the dressing room is also very good. Will try to keep enjoying and keep winning games for the team. &quot;</strong></span></p>\n",

            "PreMatchCommentary": "<p>Hello and Welcome everyone, It is time has come for the biggest sporting festival of the country, The Indian Premier League. The tournament opener of the 16th edition of the league will be held at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium where the defending Champions Gujarat Titans will lock horns with the four-time Champions Chennai Super Kings. The audience in attendance will not only be excited to see their home team perform in front of them but also for the return of &#39;Thala&#39; Mahendra Singh Dhoni who takes the field in what might just be his last tournament. The season introduces a new set of rules which makes the format even more interesting, the most exciting of which is the <strong>&#39;IMPACT PLAYER RULE&#39;</strong> which allows the teams to include a player who is not a part of the Playing 11 in the side at any moment in either inning. Another rule is the one that gives the bowling side a provision to take DRS for a &#39;Wide or No Ball&#39; called by the On-field Umpire. Also, the captains will now be allowed to name the playing 11 after the Toss takes place.<br />\nThe Titans will look to start their campaign on a winning note considering the success they had against their opponents in the last year&#39;s edition. Super Kings exited the tournament in the group stage last year but can never be taken lightly as the team is no short of firepower and experience in the camp. Both sides have some exciting talents in their ranks which ensures a cracker of a contest, to say the least. CSK side looks star-studded with the likes of MSD, Rururaj Gaikwad, Ravindra Jadeja, and the newly included Ben Stokes who makes the balance of the side a lot better. GT on the other side has not made many changes to their winning combination which includes the likes of Skipper Hardik Pandya, Shubman Gill, Rashid Khan, and the newly inducted Kane Williamson who brings a lot more solidity to their batting unit. Let the contest between the Master MSD and apprentice Hardik Pandya begin!&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>HEAD TO HEAD:</strong><br />\nBoth the clashes between&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:28px; width:66px\" title=\"\" /> and&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/CSK-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:31px; width:82px\" title=\"\" />have been won by the Titans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:</strong></p>\n\n<p><br />\nThe<strong>&nbsp;Average first innings score</strong> at the Narendra Modi Stadium is <strong>154</strong>.&nbsp;<br />\n<strong>Winning Total at the venue is 175.</strong><br />\nOut of the<strong> 7 IPL games</strong>, <strong>5 </strong>have been won by the team batting second.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:-</strong><br />\n&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:28px; width:66px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;win the toss and elect to field first!</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain:</strong></span> &quot;We&#39;ll field first. It is always good to play here being the home team. New start, new season, it is quite exciting with the whole build up to the tournament. I have been a huge fan and admirer of MS and have looked to learn from him whenever playing with or against him. &nbsp;Want the team to go out there with a smile and enjoy themselves and the Result will take care of itself. The Playing combination is something that I leave up to Ashish Nehra who does all the thinking being the coach of the team.&quot;&nbsp;<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain</strong>:</span> &quot;We would have bowled as well. Looks like a good wicket and I don&#39;t think it will change much during the course of the game. Not sure if there will be dew because it rained last night. &nbsp;This stadium&#39;s capacity is twice the of other stadiums in the country so it would be some experience in this Fantastic atmosphere. The preparation leading up to the tournament was good. We assembled quite early for the camp and trained together with the unit. The new rule introduced makes it interesting and it&#39;s a luxury to have an impact player which can be introduced depending upon the situation.&quot;&nbsp;</p>\n",

It seemed like Ruturaj Gaikwad <img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/fire.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" />was playing on a different track altogether as the opener smashed 92 of just 50 balls at a staggering strike rate of 184. None of the other batters got going and CSK managed to set a target of 179 for the defending Champions. In response,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https://bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com/matchcentre/images/commentary/smiley/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" />&nbsp;started well Saha, Gill, and Sai Sudarshan all got off to good starts and played as per the situation demanded. Shubman Gill top scored with 63 of just 36 balls putting the titans in the driver&#39;s seat in the run-chase. CSK did come back in the match after the dismissal of Gill but some valuable cameos from Vijay Shankar, Rahul Tewatia and most importantly Rashid Khan took GT home with 4 balls to spare. Khan smashed 10 runs off 3 balls when the team was needing 10 runs per over. The first match of IPL 2023&nbsp; delivered as promised as the match could have gone either way till the very last over!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya, Gujarat Titans Captain: &quot;Obviously very happy with the outcome. We did put ourselves in a difficult situation in the end but Rahul Tewatia and Rashid Khan did brilliantly. We were happy at the mid-innings because at one point CSK were going well and looked like getting 200 plus, but we got those couple of wickets to pull things back. Having Rashid Khan is a real asset, he will get you wickets and get you some runs too. As batters we need to take responsibility so the lower order does not have pressure when they come into bat, This is something which we will look to improve upon, our shot selection.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Chennai Super Kings Captain: &quot;There was always going to be dew but the batting unit could have done a bit more. Ruturaj Gaikwad was brilliant throughout and deserved a century, it is a pleasure to watch him bat when he times the ball like this. I think it is important for youngsters to step up. I think Raj Hangargekar has good pace and will only get better with time.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">RASHID KHAN is the Player of the Match.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rashid Khan: &quot;So very happy to receive this crucial Man of the Match. It Will give me a lot of energy for the rest of the tournament. I always try to do my best in all three formats and give it all in the practice and training sessions too. The plan is a bit hard to bowl to lefties, but the idea was to keep it tight and I knew in my mind that if I keep it simple and get two wickets, we will be definitely back in the game. Very happy with the way things went&quot;</strong></span></p>\n",
